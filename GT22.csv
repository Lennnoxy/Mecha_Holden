MooshRum#3936,15-Jan-18 06:50 PM,You are more likely for a 4 person dorm but if they dont have an opening,
MooshRum#3936,15-Jan-18 06:50 PM,¯\_(ツ)_/¯,

naseem1378#1085,15-Jan-18 06:56 PM,i signed up for FE was that the wrong decision?,
MooshRum#3936,15-Jan-18 06:56 PM,"here are teh smith showers, the lines seperating them are curtains",https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/402517390669381633/402612109340442626/unknown.png
MooshRum#3936,15-Jan-18 06:56 PM,you have to go through other peoples showers to get to yours,
naseem1378#1085,15-Jan-18 06:56 PM,that's awful,
MooshRum#3936,15-Jan-18 06:56 PM,its just really awkward,
Thedarkbobman#8576,15-Jan-18 06:57 PM,wtf,
Thedarkbobman#8576,15-Jan-18 06:57 PM,who designed that,
shortgiraffes#1231,15-Jan-18 06:57 PM,thats disgusting,
shortgiraffes#1231,15-Jan-18 06:57 PM,why,
MooshRum#3936,15-Jan-18 06:57 PM,i think they might have made them slightly better,
Snowfish#4289,15-Jan-18 06:57 PM,FE just kinda bottlenecks you into having a more expensive meal plan but you have more swipes,
MooshRum#3936,15-Jan-18 06:57 PM,idk,
shortgiraffes#1231,15-Jan-18 06:57 PM,would they make that a thing,
Snowfish#4289,15-Jan-18 06:57 PM,that's really all it does,
suyashr99#7560,15-Jan-18 06:57 PM,is FE fine to sign up for?,
suyashr99#7560,15-Jan-18 06:57 PM,also where is the sign up for that,
MooshRum#3936,15-Jan-18 06:57 PM,I would recommend against it,
MooshRum#3936,15-Jan-18 06:57 PM,its pretty useless tbh,
suyashr99#7560,15-Jan-18 06:57 PM,ok cool thanks,
FaitDuVent#4537,15-Jan-18 06:57 PM,GA Tech has lots of engineering graduates yet they can't design a shower room 👀,
MooshRum#3936,15-Jan-18 06:57 PM,well its a bonding experience,
MooshRum#3936,15-Jan-18 06:58 PM,people who go to smith and make it through it brings people together,
FaitDuVent#4537,15-Jan-18 06:58 PM,it's not bonding it's embarrassing and weird,
MooshRum#3936,15-Jan-18 06:58 PM,its a guy only dorm pretty sure,
suyashr99#7560,15-Jan-18 06:58 PM,is this like a concentration camp thing,
MooshRum#3936,15-Jan-18 06:58 PM,they change yearly on what is and isnt a guy only dorm tho,
shortgiraffes#1231,15-Jan-18 06:58 PM,time to only shower at 2am if I end up in smith dear god,
MooshRum#3936,15-Jan-18 06:58 PM,yeah people in smith really learned which showers to take and at what times,
FaitDuVent#4537,15-Jan-18 06:58 PM,oh,
naseem1378#1085,15-Jan-18 06:58 PM,are my chances of ending up in a bad dorm higher bc of FE?,
FaitDuVent#4537,15-Jan-18 06:58 PM,so all dorms are all guys or all girls?,
FaitDuVent#4537,15-Jan-18 06:58 PM,are there co ed dorms?,

jakchoy#8192,15-Jan-18 06:59 PM,most are co ed to my knowledge,
FaitDuVent#4537,15-Jan-18 06:59 PM,cool,
Snowfish#4289,15-Jan-18 06:59 PM,FE doesnt really do anything about dorms i don't think,
MooshRum#3936,15-Jan-18 06:59 PM,They are normally Co-ed per floor,

jakchoy#8192,15-Jan-18 07:00 PM,these bathroom drawings have such artistic qualities,
MooshRum#3936,15-Jan-18 07:00 PM,too bad GT cares about that,

Snowfish#4289,15-Jan-18 07:00 PM,no,
suyashr99#7560,15-Jan-18 07:01 PM,coz they have no shame,
MooshRum#3936,15-Jan-18 07:01 PM,People are pretty respectful in the showers,
Snowfish#4289,15-Jan-18 07:01 PM,you have like a moderate amount of privacy,
Snowfish#4289,15-Jan-18 07:01 PM,if you have the normal bathrooms,
MooshRum#3936,15-Jan-18 07:01 PM,even in smith people learn to not go into the shower if someone is showering,
Snowfish#4289,15-Jan-18 07:01 PM,the only time someone has invaded my privacy is when some drunk girl thought i wasnt in the shower,
MooshRum#3936,15-Jan-18 07:01 PM,Accurate,
MooshRum#3936,15-Jan-18 07:01 PM,that will happen,

MooshRum#3936,15-Jan-18 07:02 PM,A lot of people like west campus because its pretty quiet but its far away from a lot of classes,

MooshRum#3936,15-Jan-18 07:03 PM,I think so,
suyashr99#7560,15-Jan-18 07:03 PM,that for engineering and shit west campus is closer to classes,
suyashr99#7560,15-Jan-18 07:04 PM,and for business east,
Snowfish#4289,15-Jan-18 07:04 PM,yea,

MooshRum#3936,15-Jan-18 07:04 PM,Yea,
MooshRum#3936,15-Jan-18 07:04 PM,but west is far away in general,
MooshRum#3936,15-Jan-18 07:04 PM,the busses dont go by west as often as east,
Snowfish#4289,15-Jan-18 07:04 PM,"freshman classes are closer to the main freshman dorms, which are on east",
Snowfish#4289,15-Jan-18 07:04 PM,unless you get the instructional center,

suyashr99#7560,15-Jan-18 07:27 PM,It's foreign or philosophy right,
Snowfish#4289,15-Jan-18 07:27 PM,you need 2 humanities,
shortgiraffes#1231,15-Jan-18 07:27 PM,does that mean I get to skip it at tech,
Snowfish#4289,15-Jan-18 07:27 PM,probably,
MooshRum#3936,15-Jan-18 07:27 PM,"No, its just humanities @suyashr99#7560",
suyashr99#7560,15-Jan-18 07:27 PM,Wow that's amazing,
Snowfish#4289,15-Jan-18 07:27 PM,might want to check equivalencies,
FaitDuVent#4537,15-Jan-18 07:27 PM,i thought about applying for int affairs,

MooshRum#3936,15-Jan-18 07:29 PM,you take health,
Snowfish#4289,15-Jan-18 07:29 PM,you take health or pe,
MooshRum#3936,15-Jan-18 07:29 PM,and you can either take the health with exercising,
MooshRum#3936,15-Jan-18 07:29 PM,or health with just more tests,
Snowfish#4289,15-Jan-18 07:29 PM,you can either shit in a room for 3 hours and listen about how you have to have safe sex and be happy with your life,
Snowfish#4289,15-Jan-18 07:29 PM,or run aroun dfor 3 hours,

Snowfish#4289,15-Jan-18 07:30 PM,give them their first semester at least,
FaitDuVent#4537,15-Jan-18 07:30 PM,learning about safe sex sounds actually important,
ZeroTwo#9586,15-Jan-18 07:30 PM,i already know the safest sex is abstinence,
FaitDuVent#4537,15-Jan-18 07:31 PM,lol,
MooshRum#3936,15-Jan-18 07:31 PM,you dont learn anything about safe sex,
MooshRum#3936,15-Jan-18 07:31 PM,you learn about like diabetes,

MooshRum#3936,15-Jan-18 07:36 PM,Im almost finished with it,
WintersFury#8466,15-Jan-18 07:36 PM,oh right you shit on EIA earlier i remember,
Snowfish#4289,15-Jan-18 07:36 PM,use the AP credit,
arechawla#3188,15-Jan-18 07:36 PM,ok,
Snowfish#4289,15-Jan-18 07:36 PM,it exempts you from a python class which is useless,
MooshRum#3936,15-Jan-18 07:36 PM,use the credit but make sure you know java,
Snowfish#4289,15-Jan-18 07:36 PM,you'll pretty much retake it anyways,
arechawla#3188,15-Jan-18 07:36 PM,Alright,
arechawla#3188,15-Jan-18 07:36 PM,I mean im no Java god I just know what's taught in AP Comp Sci A,

Snowfish#4289,15-Jan-18 07:37 PM,you get out of 1301 which is exclusively python (i think) and you have to take 1331 which is introduction to java,

WintersFury#8466,15-Jan-18 07:38 PM,cause im taking multi right now but not distance so i have to place in,
Snowfish#4289,15-Jan-18 07:38 PM,"one is civil engineering, one is computer engineering, and one is electrical engineering",
Snowfish#4289,15-Jan-18 07:39 PM,if you pass the test you get credit for the class,
FaitDuVent#4537,15-Jan-18 07:39 PM,LMC = word engineering 😎,
WintersFury#8466,15-Jan-18 07:39 PM,pretty simple,
Chafos#1781,15-Jan-18 07:39 PM,I believe electrical engineering is just hardware whereas computer engineering can cover some of the actual firmware or even software aspects of the computer you're engineering as well,
Snowfish#4289,15-Jan-18 07:40 PM,yeah pretty much,
Snowfish#4289,15-Jan-18 07:40 PM,i think you learn a little bit of CS with comp eng,
Chafos#1781,15-Jan-18 07:42 PM,"yup, that's why I originally was going for comp eng, but I started to realize I didn't like the hardware/engineering aspects of it",
Snowfish#4289,15-Jan-18 07:42 PM,CS has a lot of options for what you want to do with it,
Snowfish#4289,15-Jan-18 07:42 PM,the 8 threads etc,
Snowfish#4289,15-Jan-18 07:42 PM,https://www.cc.gatech.edu/academics/degree-programs/bachelors/computer-science/threads <-- make sure you look through these,

Snowfish#4289,15-Jan-18 07:43 PM,what 4 are you between,
Snowfish#4289,15-Jan-18 07:43 PM,should probably pin that in the CS channel,

Chafos#1781,15-Jan-18 07:48 PM,@jakchoy#8192 you should have made the major-specific chats only accessible to people with the same role as the chat,
jakchoy#8192,15-Jan-18 07:48 PM,"i was thinking of that, but in case ppl were interested in switching majors",
Chafos#1781,15-Jan-18 07:48 PM,because we're all gonna get messages from all the chats and I don't wanna have to mute 14+ chats,
jakchoy#8192,15-Jan-18 07:48 PM,or wanted help on their classes,
Snowfish#4289,15-Jan-18 07:48 PM,then they could opt into the major,
Snowfish#4289,15-Jan-18 07:48 PM,¯\_(ツ)_/¯,
jakchoy#8192,15-Jan-18 07:49 PM,uh,

Sumedh_G#6616,17-Jan-18 01:13 AM,Agh this whole groupme stuff is annoying,
tickl#0001,17-Jan-18 01:38 AM,Groupme is a cancer that will never die,
jakchoy#8192,17-Jan-18 01:41 AM,uh did someone spam,
jakchoy#8192,17-Jan-18 01:42 AM,if so pls tell me which channel,
thedragonlegacy#2854,17-Jan-18 01:46 AM,ppl spammed groupme lmao,
thedragonlegacy#2854,17-Jan-18 01:46 AM,or bots.,
jakchoy#8192,17-Jan-18 01:46 AM,o,
jakchoy#8192,17-Jan-18 01:46 AM,rip groupme lol,
thedragonlegacy#2854,17-Jan-18 01:47 AM,honestly. -_- super frustrating,
Arya201#6452,17-Jan-18 02:19 AM,Think I'll just quit groupme,
Arya201#6452,17-Jan-18 02:19 AM,It's annoying,
Arya201#6452,17-Jan-18 02:19 AM,And weird,
8726andrew#5709,17-Jan-18 08:11 AM,The group me is basically worthless now,
8726andrew#5709,17-Jan-18 08:12 AM,A lot of people left/got kicked,
thedragonlegacy#2854,17-Jan-18 10:49 AM,^,
thedragonlegacy#2854,17-Jan-18 10:51 AM,thank to some fucking idiots.,
Rye#0666,17-Jan-18 10:53 AM,GroupMe isn't very good for large groups,
thedragonlegacy#2854,17-Jan-18 10:58 AM,"i agree fully, but those who don't game/discord are people who are familiar with groupme. easier platform to get a diversity of majors",
Sumedh_G#6616,17-Jan-18 11:15 AM,"yeah groupme was the one that most people already had or knew of, so thats i guess why we used it in the first place",
thedragonlegacy#2854,17-Jan-18 11:19 AM,probably should suggest migrating to discord in case it happens again,
Sumedh_G#6616,17-Jan-18 11:24 AM,yeahh,
Sumedh_G#6616,17-Jan-18 11:24 AM,on the chillzone server its getting lit,
Sumedh_G#6616,17-Jan-18 11:24 AM,*channel,
8726andrew#5709,17-Jan-18 11:26 AM,Lol I managed to get a group of my friends to migrate from Skype to discord,
Sumedh_G#6616,17-Jan-18 11:27 AM,thats good,
8726andrew#5709,17-Jan-18 11:27 AM,For whatever reason they went from groupme to skype which was a downgrade tbh,
thedragonlegacy#2854,17-Jan-18 11:28 AM,OH i forgot about chillzone,
Rye#0666,17-Jan-18 11:28 AM,Skype in 2018 :blobhyperthink: :blobhyperthink: :blobhyperthinkfast: :blobhyperthinkfast:,
thedragonlegacy#2854,17-Jan-18 11:28 AM,thank god @8726andrew#5709,
Rye#0666,17-Jan-18 11:29 AM,"Now that Discord has video calls and screensharing, there's no point to switch back",
8726andrew#5709,17-Jan-18 11:30 AM,Yeah that’s what I said plus the Skype mobile app was worthless and that convinced all of them,
thedragonlegacy#2854,17-Jan-18 11:30 AM,^,
8726andrew#5709,17-Jan-18 11:30 AM,For whatever reason it just wouldn’t send notifications for messages regularly whereas discord actually does,
Lordbobby104#0879,17-Jan-18 11:52 AM,Discord is definitely the superior platform,
Chafos#1781,17-Jan-18 11:53 AM,Discord spam > GroupMe spam,
thedragonlegacy#2854,17-Jan-18 11:55 AM,^^^,
thedragonlegacy#2854,17-Jan-18 11:56 AM,there's actually developed bots to stop spam,
8726andrew#5709,17-Jan-18 12:01 PM,and you can delete the spam after they get banned,
Lordbobby104#0879,17-Jan-18 12:01 PM,Yeah,
8726andrew#5709,17-Jan-18 12:02 PM,whereas on the groupme rn its about like 5+ screens of cancer trying to scroll up,
Rye#0666,17-Jan-18 12:04 PM,Plus no custom emotes on GroupMe :SquidDab:,
Rye#0666,17-Jan-18 12:04 PM,And you can't organize and search for messages,
8726andrew#5709,17-Jan-18 12:05 PM,although setting up a group is easier and more people use groupme,
8726andrew#5709,17-Jan-18 12:06 PM,its just not good for 100+ people,
8726andrew#5709,17-Jan-18 12:06 PM,when groups get that big it ends up with a few people talking and most people muting it and never saying anything,
Rye#0666,17-Jan-18 12:07 PM,Fo sho fo sho,
Rye#0666,17-Jan-18 12:24 PM,I love how CS has by far the most users online,

Rye#0666,18-Jan-18 12:05 AM,And we had to write a practice essay about centripetal and centrifugal forces. I defined both words correctly and gave adequate examples but I accidentally swapped the words when I defined them. So my teacher gave me a 57 on my essay instead of like a 93. I lost so many points because I had two very similar words swapped. I didn't even get credit on my examples. Anyways my grade dropped to like an 88 or something. I swear I was about to get a B. But then I got a 95 on the final and it replaced my lowest test grade iirc so I got a 91 in the class,

Rye#0666,18-Jan-18 02:37 PM,I think someone said over four years,
kk4jrq#5652,18-Jan-18 02:37 PM,100k is more accurate,
MEE6#4876,18-Jan-18 02:37 PM,"GG @kk4jrq#5652, you just advanced to level 5!",

Lordbobby104#0879,18-Jan-18 02:38 PM,Yeah zell just covers tuition,
Lordbobby104#0879,18-Jan-18 02:38 PM,"So add in room and board, fees, and books",
Lordbobby104#0879,18-Jan-18 02:40 PM,and shit gets expensive,

kk4jrq#5652,18-Jan-18 02:40 PM,Yep... GT is expensive,
Rye#0666,18-Jan-18 02:40 PM,Boi I applied to UGA,
Rye#0666,18-Jan-18 02:40 PM,Don't make fun of me,
8726andrew#5709,18-Jan-18 02:41 PM,lol i only say that bc i hated uga when i went there,
Rye#0666,18-Jan-18 02:41 PM,I liked the campus,
kk4jrq#5652,18-Jan-18 02:41 PM,But... It is the best value degree in the naation,
IlliNOICE#5464,18-Jan-18 02:41 PM,uga campus no bueno,
8726andrew#5709,18-Jan-18 02:41 PM,^,
8726andrew#5709,18-Jan-18 02:41 PM,my tour was shitty when i went there,
Lordbobby104#0879,18-Jan-18 02:41 PM,The campus is huge,
MEE6#4876,18-Jan-18 02:41 PM,"GG @Lordbobby104#0879, you just advanced to level 5!",
arechawla#3188,18-Jan-18 02:41 PM,What makes it 20k a year not including tuition,
Lordbobby104#0879,18-Jan-18 02:41 PM,Be prepared to do a lot of walking,
Rye#0666,18-Jan-18 02:42 PM,Yeah it's pretty spread out,
kk4jrq#5652,18-Jan-18 02:42 PM,"Fees, books , and dorm costs",
Lordbobby104#0879,18-Jan-18 02:42 PM,Being duel enrolled there kinda sucks because of it,
arechawla#3188,18-Jan-18 02:42 PM,Dang,
8726andrew#5709,18-Jan-18 02:42 PM,housing is expensive,
Lordbobby104#0879,18-Jan-18 02:43 PM,Were you calculating with the cheapest housing?,
kk4jrq#5652,18-Jan-18 02:43 PM,Yep.,
8726andrew#5709,18-Jan-18 02:44 PM,housing goes up after freshman year,
Rye#0666,18-Jan-18 02:44 PM,Yeah,
kk4jrq#5652,18-Jan-18 02:44 PM,Living downtown is straight up expensive,
Rye#0666,18-Jan-18 02:44 PM,Dorms are like over $6k for both semesters,
Rye#0666,18-Jan-18 02:44 PM,And then obviously it goes up,
IlliNOICE#5464,18-Jan-18 02:44 PM,you can get apartments that are cheaper than undergrad dorms,
IlliNOICE#5464,18-Jan-18 02:44 PM,and like nice apartments,
Lordbobby104#0879,18-Jan-18 02:45 PM,Yeah with room mates you could definitely make off campus housing cheaper,
8726andrew#5709,18-Jan-18 02:45 PM,yeah i was thinking if there was some way to game it like that,
8726andrew#5709,18-Jan-18 02:45 PM,problem is tech is close to the shitty areas of downtown,
8726andrew#5709,18-Jan-18 02:45 PM,and you could get mugged,
IlliNOICE#5464,18-Jan-18 02:46 PM,the issue is that the entire area west of campus is sketchy af,
thedragonlegacy#2854,18-Jan-18 02:46 PM,"just use common sense and don't be alone near those areas, esp at night",
IlliNOICE#5464,18-Jan-18 02:46 PM,so if you want an apartment and dont want to be mugged theres only one side of campus for it to be on,
Lordbobby104#0879,18-Jan-18 02:46 PM,Just be smart,
8726andrew#5709,18-Jan-18 02:46 PM,sometimes shit just happens,
thedragonlegacy#2854,18-Jan-18 02:46 PM,mhm,
Lordbobby104#0879,18-Jan-18 02:47 PM,Muggers look for easy targets,
thedragonlegacy#2854,18-Jan-18 02:47 PM,so... get ripped,
thedragonlegacy#2854,18-Jan-18 02:47 PM,;p,
Rye#0666,18-Jan-18 02:47 PM,There was a group of like 7 students that got robbed last semester,

Rye#0666,18-Jan-18 02:47 PM,Yeah,
Rye#0666,18-Jan-18 02:48 PM,I remember the police shooting too and the group chat had a big debate about it,
Lordbobby104#0879,18-Jan-18 02:48 PM,"Walk in a group, don't walk around looking at your phones, walk with a purpose, don't go out at night if you don't have to, etc",

kk4jrq#5652,18-Jan-18 02:48 PM,^^^^^,
Rye#0666,18-Jan-18 02:48 PM,"Also if you get robbed, give them what they want then call the police when it's safe",
Rye#0666,18-Jan-18 02:48 PM,It's not worth risking your life to keep your possessions safe,
Lordbobby104#0879,18-Jan-18 02:48 PM,Yeah. Don't try to be bruce lee or some shit xD,

Lordbobby104#0879,18-Jan-18 02:50 PM,Kick em in the balls,
Lordbobby104#0879,18-Jan-18 02:50 PM,Happens in all college towns,
Lordbobby104#0879,18-Jan-18 02:50 PM,Happens in cities in general,
IlliNOICE#5464,18-Jan-18 02:51 PM,its also atlanta lol,

Rye#0666,18-Jan-18 02:51 PM,Yeah the area around the campus isn't the best,
8726andrew#5709,18-Jan-18 02:51 PM,i mean it is atlanta,
8726andrew#5709,18-Jan-18 02:51 PM,what are you really expecting,
Rye#0666,18-Jan-18 02:51 PM,"Just be careful, walk in groups, and be alert",
Rye#0666,18-Jan-18 02:51 PM,And don't walk late at night,
Lordbobby104#0879,18-Jan-18 02:53 PM,You'd think it'd be common sense,
kk4jrq#5652,18-Jan-18 02:53 PM,Yeah well even if you do all that it is still a dangerous place,
Rye#0666,18-Jan-18 02:54 PM,I'll hire a private military to guard me,
Rye#0666,18-Jan-18 02:54 PM,That should work,
Lordbobby104#0879,18-Jan-18 02:54 PM,Lol,

Rye#0666,19-Jan-18 11:50 PM,I took it once and got a higher score than I was predicted to and it was high enough for where I wanted to go so I didn't bother taking the ACT,

Lordbobby104#0879,20-Jan-18 12:06 AM,Even tho trump says otherwise xD,
Rye#0666,20-Jan-18 12:06 AM,Lol,
Quantum#1480,20-Jan-18 12:08 AM,Nah according to Fox News laws don't apply anymore,
Quantum#1480,20-Jan-18 12:08 AM,so rip,
Rye#0666,20-Jan-18 12:08 AM,It's not that bad. They've happened in the past. It's mainly pretty bad because GOP has control of both parts of Congress and I think this really only happens when there's a lot of partisanship,
Quantum#1480,20-Jan-18 12:08 AM,Well there was a good chance for this to not happen,
Quantum#1480,20-Jan-18 12:08 AM,There was a bipartisan bill,
Quantum#1480,20-Jan-18 12:09 AM,But McConnel didn't put it up for a vote,
Lordbobby104#0879,20-Jan-18 12:09 AM,Yeah but the senate didn't consult the house,
Lordbobby104#0879,20-Jan-18 12:09 AM,And Trump wasn't having it,
Lordbobby104#0879,20-Jan-18 12:09 AM,so it was dead on arrival,
Quantum#1480,20-Jan-18 12:10 AM,Well Trump did go on TV and say he'd sign any bipartisan bill,
Lordbobby104#0879,20-Jan-18 12:10 AM,Well Trump is known to be a man of his word... xD,
Quantum#1480,20-Jan-18 12:11 AM,Then his staffers told him not to and he retracted it lol,
Lordbobby104#0879,20-Jan-18 12:12 AM,O well,
Lordbobby104#0879,20-Jan-18 12:12 AM,Hopefully they can figure it out soon,
Lordbobby104#0879,20-Jan-18 12:12 AM,Not like its their job or anything,
thedragonlegacy#2854,20-Jan-18 12:13 AM,eh i think tech corporations will eventually overturn our modern governments,
thedragonlegacy#2854,20-Jan-18 12:13 AM,in the future ofc,
Lordbobby104#0879,20-Jan-18 12:13 AM,That would be a sight,
thedragonlegacy#2854,20-Jan-18 12:15 AM,the ceo of google was seen with a book about world domination,
thedragonlegacy#2854,20-Jan-18 12:15 AM,it's not just a sight,
Lordbobby104#0879,20-Jan-18 12:16 AM,Google pretty much dominates the world already,
Lordbobby104#0879,20-Jan-18 12:16 AM,Tech companies in general,
Lordbobby104#0879,20-Jan-18 12:16 AM,By controlling what the people have access to and see,
thedragonlegacy#2854,20-Jan-18 12:16 AM,yeah.,
Quantum#1480,20-Jan-18 12:16 AM,And through amassing everyone's data,
thedragonlegacy#2854,20-Jan-18 12:18 AM,"i actually wrote this for a college app, but the current govt functions slowly due to lack of priority towards integrated tech. it's more of an afterthought, like, ""ughhh we need this thing to support us""... rather than actually create legistlation to encourage direct involvment with tech dev",
Quantum#1480,20-Jan-18 12:19 AM,Arguably having less government intervention in the tech space leads to more innovations and people organically creating new products and technologies,
thedragonlegacy#2854,20-Jan-18 12:19 AM,"hence, further separation from tech conglomerates will eventually lead to next formation of a new govt",
thedragonlegacy#2854,20-Jan-18 12:20 AM,hmm I'm not saying in restricting,
thedragonlegacy#2854,20-Jan-18 12:20 AM,but having it well integrated and prioritize in govt functions,
Lennox#3038,20-Jan-18 12:20 AM,Unless you're dealing gov't contracts or objectives @Quantum#1480,
Lennox#3038,20-Jan-18 12:20 AM,eg nasa and military,
Lennox#3038,20-Jan-18 12:21 AM,space race,
Lennox#3038,20-Jan-18 12:21 AM,all that good stuff,
thedragonlegacy#2854,20-Jan-18 12:21 AM,"government technology, for bureaus and civil things, seem neglected. it takes weeks and months to process and process",
Quantum#1480,20-Jan-18 12:21 AM,"Yeah if you're talking about overarching public initiatives that no one company could do, but in a tech perspective then I think that would be cool",
Quantum#1480,20-Jan-18 12:22 AM,Well that stems from a fear of security of various technologies,
Quantum#1480,20-Jan-18 12:22 AM,I fear that I don't think is without basis,
thedragonlegacy#2854,20-Jan-18 12:24 AM,"that's true, but i think since we are in the technology revolution age, there should be greater emphasis on tech dev in govt.",
Quantum#1480,20-Jan-18 12:24 AM,I think so too,
thedragonlegacy#2854,20-Jan-18 12:24 AM,that's only if they want to be a longlasting institution,
Lordbobby104#0879,20-Jan-18 12:25 AM,I agree with you,
Lordbobby104#0879,20-Jan-18 12:25 AM,Only within the last 10 years has the military put an emphasis on cyber warfare in terms of organization and money,
Quantum#1480,20-Jan-18 12:26 AM,This is similar to the discussion about bringing more scientific literacy to the government. There's a lot of people asking more scientists to run for office to bring more of a science focus to the gov,
Lordbobby104#0879,20-Jan-18 12:27 AM,I've been looking into Army Cyber Command as a possibly option after college and it amazed me to realize how little funding it had gotten till a few years ago,
Lordbobby104#0879,20-Jan-18 12:28 AM,Like I can understand civil issues but I figured the defense of cyber space would be more of a focus,
Lennox#3038,20-Jan-18 12:28 AM,"To be fair, it is a relatively recent phenomenon",
Lennox#3038,20-Jan-18 12:29 AM,Government isn't exactly known for doing things quickly,
Lordbobby104#0879,20-Jan-18 12:29 AM,True,
Lordbobby104#0879,20-Jan-18 12:29 AM,xD,
thedragonlegacy#2854,20-Jan-18 12:29 AM,"That is true, but companies and tech are evolving rapidly. And that weakness will be a downfall",
Quantum#1480,20-Jan-18 12:29 AM,Well the private sector has always evolved faster than the government,
Lennox#3038,20-Jan-18 12:30 AM,"The DoD, realizing this, has made efforts to foster greater integration with the civilian sector over the past ten years",
Quantum#1480,20-Jan-18 12:30 AM,Hence why it took us so long to react to big oil and the telecom companies,
thedragonlegacy#2854,20-Jan-18 12:30 AM,"@Quantum#1480 hmm i feel like scientific isn't as comparable to tech. Tech ins extremely integral to civilians, society, and culture",
Quantum#1480,20-Jan-18 12:31 AM,Fair enough,
Quantum#1480,20-Jan-18 12:31 AM,There is something to be said (that I agree with) that this tech revolution will be fundamentally different than the ones in the past,
thedragonlegacy#2854,20-Jan-18 12:31 AM,hmm how so? @Lennox#3038,
Quantum#1480,20-Jan-18 12:31 AM,Especially in terms of autonomy and displacing the workforce,
thedragonlegacy#2854,20-Jan-18 12:32 AM,Yes... definitely agreeable,
Lennox#3038,20-Jan-18 12:32 AM,https://fas.org/sgp/crs/natsec/R44010.pdf,
Lennox#3038,20-Jan-18 12:32 AM,fun little paper,
Lennox#3038,20-Jan-18 12:32 AM,There's a graph on page 8 which details the extensions of contractual obligation,
Lennox#3038,20-Jan-18 12:33 AM,"I did research on this topic like a year ago, so I have a bunch of leftover sources",
Lennox#3038,20-Jan-18 12:34 AM,Basically the UN and DoD spent a bunch of money to figure out that international competition works better than paying to do stuff in house,
Lennox#3038,20-Jan-18 12:34 AM,So they put that down as an objective moving forward,
Lennox#3038,20-Jan-18 12:35 AM,but objectives aren't always what ends up happening so idk,
thedragonlegacy#2854,20-Jan-18 12:35 AM,so what do you mean by international competition?,
Lennox#3038,20-Jan-18 12:36 AM,"Private companies have to function under the influence of market pressures, which naturally makes them more efficient",
Lennox#3038,20-Jan-18 12:36 AM,to survive,
thedragonlegacy#2854,20-Jan-18 12:36 AM,ahh,
Lennox#3038,20-Jan-18 12:36 AM,The military can exist in a little bubble if they arent careful,
Lennox#3038,20-Jan-18 12:36 AM,No pressure for innovation if the money keeps coming,
Lordbobby104#0879,20-Jan-18 12:37 AM,Very true,
Lordbobby104#0879,20-Jan-18 12:37 AM,Usually the pressure comes from a foreign threat though,
Lordbobby104#0879,20-Jan-18 12:37 AM,Which has fueled some of the biggest advances in history,
Quantum#1480,20-Jan-18 12:37 AM,Can free market theories be applied to a national security field where there's a lot of secrecy?,
thedragonlegacy#2854,20-Jan-18 12:38 AM,hmm interesting point,
Lordbobby104#0879,20-Jan-18 12:38 AM,I think they can to a point. But the commodities change,

thedragonlegacy#2854,20-Jan-18 12:40 AM,wait,
thedragonlegacy#2854,20-Jan-18 12:41 AM,so how is the DoD integrating the civilian sector if it's outsourcing contracts?,
Quantum#1480,20-Jan-18 12:41 AM,I would assume the contracts are being given to the civilian sector,
Lennox#3038,20-Jan-18 12:41 AM,The contracts go towards private companies,
Lordbobby104#0879,20-Jan-18 12:41 AM,"From what I've seen, they are bringing in the civilian sector to work with them on base also",
Lordbobby104#0879,20-Jan-18 12:42 AM,"From the research I did about Army Cyber, in the last few years they relocated their base of operations to augusta and built a completely new facility that is designed to incorporated both military and civilians",

Marksn#1322,24-Jan-18 05:00 PM,is there anyone interested in the invention studio?,
Alfred Borden#6177,24-Jan-18 05:02 PM,What does it entail?,
Marksn#1322,24-Jan-18 05:03 PM,its like a section of a building at tech that houses equipment to make basically whatever you want,
MEE6#4876,24-Jan-18 05:03 PM,"GG @Marksn#1322, you just advanced to level 4!",
Marksn#1322,24-Jan-18 05:03 PM,From my understanding you can make stuff for projects or just random stuff,
Alfred Borden#6177,24-Jan-18 05:06 PM,Damn,
Alfred Borden#6177,24-Jan-18 05:06 PM,I’m very interested,
Marksn#1322,24-Jan-18 05:07 PM,its pretty damn cool,
lerk1#6965,24-Jan-18 05:07 PM,I’m interested as well,
lerk1#6965,24-Jan-18 05:07 PM,@MarkBats#6802 do you know where it is on campus?,
Marksn#1322,24-Jan-18 05:08 PM,"it was pointed out to me when i toured, but i cant quite remember exactly where. It was closer to west campus though",
Marksn#1322,24-Jan-18 05:08 PM,like beyond the civil engineering building i think,
Marksn#1322,24-Jan-18 05:10 PM,http://inventionstudio.gatech.edu/,
Marksn#1322,24-Jan-18 05:10 PM,this is the link to the gt page if ur lazy like me usually,
arechawla#3188,24-Jan-18 05:12 PM,Dang that looks hella cool,
Marksn#1322,24-Jan-18 05:13 PM,yee my dude,
Marksn#1322,24-Jan-18 05:13 PM,it is,
lerk1#6965,24-Jan-18 05:13 PM,I’m definitely going,
Marksn#1322,24-Jan-18 05:13 PM,they have a tour of the studio independent of the school tours,
arechawla#3188,24-Jan-18 05:15 PM,How do you sign up?,
Marksn#1322,24-Jan-18 05:16 PM,"Tbh i dont know, i got an email saying i was signed up bc my gt grad parent signed me up without telling me.",
Marksn#1322,24-Jan-18 05:17 PM,but im sure its on the page i sent somewhere,
Marksn#1322,24-Jan-18 05:17 PM,it is,
arechawla#3188,24-Jan-18 05:17 PM,Oh i see,
Marksn#1322,24-Jan-18 05:18 PM,"ye, it seems damn cool, and you dont have to be too pressured to work on something really crazy since in the video one of the featured projects was fixing a steel string guitar",
thedragonlegacy#2854,24-Jan-18 05:20 PM,Invention studio is amazing.,
thedragonlegacy#2854,24-Jan-18 05:21 PM,I worked in it’s during hack GT,
Marksn#1322,24-Jan-18 05:21 PM,"Im really interested in the prosthetics field of biomed so i was hoping i could find people who are making like, prototype style prosthetics. or experimenting with 3d printing",
arechawla#3188,24-Jan-18 05:22 PM,What's hack GT?,
arechawla#3188,24-Jan-18 05:23 PM,Fr tho having an easily accessible 3d printer would be amazing,
thedragonlegacy#2854,24-Jan-18 05:28 PM,They have this machine that scans an item inside it & you can literally 3D print yourself,
thedragonlegacy#2854,24-Jan-18 05:29 PM,Plus you don’t have to pay for the 3D printing material,
lerk1#6965,24-Jan-18 05:30 PM,That’s lit,
thedragonlegacy#2854,24-Jan-18 05:31 PM,Pretty sure it’s in the woodruff mech building 🤔,
thedragonlegacy#2854,24-Jan-18 05:32 PM,"But yeah it’s super lit, I want to sign up.",
thedragonlegacy#2854,24-Jan-18 05:32 PM,EZ Christmas presents xd,
8726andrew#5709,24-Jan-18 05:43 PM,Why don’t they just 3D print 3D Printers,
8726andrew#5709,24-Jan-18 05:44 PM,Then everyone could have one for free,
Cloud No. 10#2997,24-Jan-18 05:44 PM,:Thonk_transparent:,
lerk1#6965,24-Jan-18 05:45 PM,@8726andrew#5709 because it would probably cost more materials than just making the printer in a factory,
lerk1#6965,24-Jan-18 05:46 PM,"@8726andrew#5709 also, most 3D printers wouldn’t contain the materials necessary to produce a 3D printer",
8726andrew#5709,24-Jan-18 05:46 PM,Dude I’m making a joke obv there’s a reason they can’t just do that,
lerk1#6965,24-Jan-18 05:46 PM,Oh sorry didn’t realize,
thedragonlegacy#2854,24-Jan-18 05:51 PM,Xd,
Alfred Borden#6177,24-Jan-18 05:52 PM,Lol,
thedragonlegacy#2854,24-Jan-18 05:52 PM,@arechawla#3188 I realized I didn’t answer your question. HackGT is tech’s hackathon. It’s really huge and amazing! You should do it regardless of major.... the food is worth sm,
thedragonlegacy#2854,24-Jan-18 05:53 PM,The food 😍,
lerk1#6965,24-Jan-18 05:53 PM,Sounds lit,

lerk1#6965,24-Jan-18 06:09 PM,From when I visited,
arechawla#3188,24-Jan-18 06:10 PM,when did you visit,
lerk1#6965,24-Jan-18 06:12 PM,Last year,
lerk1#6965,24-Jan-18 06:12 PM,Before I applied,
arechawla#3188,24-Jan-18 06:15 PM,lit,
thedragonlegacy#2854,24-Jan-18 06:31 PM,HackGT is free & they pay for all the food,
thedragonlegacy#2854,24-Jan-18 06:31 PM,It takes over a span of 72 hours I believe ?,
thedragonlegacy#2854,24-Jan-18 06:32 PM,"They catered Mexican, good American food, etc. no pizza. They had midnight snacks; FRESH AWESOME COOKIES, popsicles, and Sweet hit boba tea",

thedragonlegacy#2854,24-Jan-18 06:34 PM,Companies/sponsors have their own prizes. I remember GE awarding iPhone X’s to whoever won their hack challenge,

Lordbobby104#0879,24-Jan-18 07:00 PM,To tech? Yeah,
Lordbobby104#0879,24-Jan-18 07:00 PM,only about an hour,
Arya201#6452,24-Jan-18 07:00 PM,So you'd be attending from home?,
Lordbobby104#0879,24-Jan-18 07:01 PM,No too far for that,
8726andrew#5709,24-Jan-18 07:01 PM,yeah tech is usually about an hour away for me too,
Lordbobby104#0879,24-Jan-18 07:01 PM,I'll probably live on campus the first year,
8726andrew#5709,24-Jan-18 07:01 PM,it can be more if theres traffic tho,
Lordbobby104#0879,24-Jan-18 07:01 PM,Yeah traffic can be a real pain,
Arya201#6452,24-Jan-18 07:01 PM,Traffic at my home country is hilarious,

sophie#9067,24-Jan-18 07:24 PM,I swear i finished it in less than 10 minutes but i didnt get a confirmation fdla;d,
Lordbobby104#0879,24-Jan-18 07:25 PM,A GT Alumni scholarship?,

sophie#9067,24-Jan-18 07:25 PM,yes,
8726andrew#5709,24-Jan-18 07:25 PM,thats odd,
sophie#9067,24-Jan-18 07:25 PM,it says on the form that if you dont get a confirmation it timed out,
sophie#9067,24-Jan-18 07:25 PM,well rip me,
8726andrew#5709,24-Jan-18 07:25 PM,rip,
shortgiraffes#1231,24-Jan-18 08:13 PM,out of curiousity bc of everyone talking about invention studio,
shortgiraffes#1231,24-Jan-18 08:13 PM,how many of you guys go to high schools with a machine lab/workshop/engineering lab?,
shortgiraffes#1231,24-Jan-18 08:14 PM,"maybe I'm an outlier bc I go to newer magnet school in my district, but we've been learning to use 3D printers and HAAS and such since like 9th grade",
shortgiraffes#1231,24-Jan-18 08:14 PM,and its really really fun,
JSnowden#8015,24-Jan-18 08:14 PM,I've got a pretty underdeveloped lab at my school (Lassiter). They have a nice 3D printer though.,
shortgiraffes#1231,24-Jan-18 08:14 PM,though if you make personal projects not class onesyou have to pay for materials,
8726andrew#5709,24-Jan-18 08:14 PM,my school doesnt really have anything cool,
8726andrew#5709,24-Jan-18 08:15 PM,most people just end up taking a ton of core classes and stuff,
Lordbobby104#0879,24-Jan-18 08:15 PM,Mine doesn't,
shortgiraffes#1231,24-Jan-18 08:15 PM,"@JSnowden#8015 Im OOS, greater LA california area",
Lordbobby104#0879,24-Jan-18 08:15 PM,We have like one 3D printer that was bought by a club,
8726andrew#5709,24-Jan-18 08:15 PM,the cool classes like that are all practically a waste of time bc of how easy they are from what ive heard,
thedragonlegacy#2854,24-Jan-18 08:15 PM,We have a nice 3D printer,
thedragonlegacy#2854,24-Jan-18 08:15 PM,our county paid a lot for it,
shortgiraffes#1231,24-Jan-18 08:16 PM,"I have to say I disagree. We use the PLTW cirriculmn and while it is sometimes a bit meh, overall I really appreciate the exposure I've gotten to everything from CAD to electronics modeling and the design process ((@8726andrew#5709))",
shortgiraffes#1231,24-Jan-18 08:16 PM,wow guess I'm spoiled then,
shortgiraffes#1231,24-Jan-18 08:17 PM,"bc my school is running about 6 makerbots, 2 HAAS, a couple lathes, an e-mill, and a lot of smaller stuff in between and its a public school",
shortgiraffes#1231,24-Jan-18 08:17 PM,but we also have no sports or music or any performing arts,
shortgiraffes#1231,24-Jan-18 08:17 PM,or like actual electives,
Rye#0666,24-Jan-18 08:17 PM,Yeah we don't really have any cool classes,
shortgiraffes#1231,24-Jan-18 08:17 PM,this is its 5th year being open,
JSnowden#8015,24-Jan-18 08:18 PM,My school is huge in music. PLTW is fairly underdeveloped here but it's getting somewhere.,
shortgiraffes#1231,24-Jan-18 08:19 PM,I really wish my school had some sort of performing arts bc I was doing ballet and flute in middle school but by high school I sorta just gradually dropped both bc its really hard to integrate extracirriculars rather than if they had been available through the school,
shortgiraffes#1231,24-Jan-18 08:19 PM,"PLTW is big at certain schools in my district, and the other schools have more established academic programs that they are known for (locally)",
8726andrew#5709,24-Jan-18 08:20 PM,@shortgiraffes#1231 im talking about the experience at my school specifically,
shortgiraffes#1231,24-Jan-18 08:20 PM,but yeah the lack of sports sucks too bc like everyone just has to do PE for two years and theres next to no school spirit,
shortgiraffes#1231,24-Jan-18 08:20 PM,"@8726andrew#5709 ah, I thought you were talking about PLTW classes in general",
8726andrew#5709,24-Jan-18 08:20 PM,lol nah,
8726andrew#5709,24-Jan-18 08:20 PM,i wish i could've taken classes like that,
8726andrew#5709,24-Jan-18 08:21 PM,i didnt have room in my schedule and it would've been a waste to make room sadly,
8726andrew#5709,24-Jan-18 08:21 PM,our school is big on football but they dont really give a shit about other sports,
thedragonlegacy#2854,24-Jan-18 08:21 PM,^^,
thedragonlegacy#2854,24-Jan-18 08:21 PM,lol,
8726andrew#5709,24-Jan-18 08:21 PM,kinda shitty for people like me bc no one ever comes out to see us run lmao but at least it gets us money,
shortgiraffes#1231,24-Jan-18 08:22 PM,we dont even have homecoming lol,
8726andrew#5709,24-Jan-18 08:22 PM,lol what,
Rye#0666,24-Jan-18 08:23 PM,Homecoming sucks from what I hear,
8726andrew#5709,24-Jan-18 08:23 PM,thats the quintessential high school garbage dance,
shortgiraffes#1231,24-Jan-18 08:23 PM,bc a) theres only one class of graduated students thus far and b) our intramurals just scrimmage the real teams of other schools after school sometimes,
Rye#0666,24-Jan-18 08:23 PM,But like,
Rye#0666,24-Jan-18 08:23 PM,How does your school not have it?,
8726andrew#5709,24-Jan-18 08:23 PM,please tell me you at least have prom,
shortgiraffes#1231,24-Jan-18 08:23 PM,we have winter formal though? and this year will be prom's second year of existence,
thedragonlegacy#2854,24-Jan-18 08:23 PM,homecoming is only fun if you attend it for 30 mins and leave for afterparty,
8726andrew#5709,24-Jan-18 08:23 PM,^,
8726andrew#5709,24-Jan-18 08:23 PM,the dance itself is garbage,
8726andrew#5709,24-Jan-18 08:23 PM,its literally in our cafeteria lmao,
shortgiraffes#1231,24-Jan-18 08:24 PM,lmao we dont have a cafeteria,
Rye#0666,24-Jan-18 08:24 PM,Have you been Andrew?,
8726andrew#5709,24-Jan-18 08:24 PM,i went like twice,
Rye#0666,24-Jan-18 08:24 PM,Where do you guys eat then?,
thedragonlegacy#2854,24-Jan-18 08:24 PM,they have luxurious dining rooms,
thedragonlegacy#2854,24-Jan-18 08:24 PM,lOL,
shortgiraffes#1231,24-Jan-18 08:24 PM,"the food stuff has its own building but you get your food from windows outside it, only the workers go inside",
shortgiraffes#1231,24-Jan-18 08:25 PM,the lunch area is just benches outside,
shortgiraffes#1231,24-Jan-18 08:25 PM,if it rains then they let people eat in the gym,
thedragonlegacy#2854,24-Jan-18 08:25 PM,but it's cold?,
8726andrew#5709,24-Jan-18 08:25 PM,lol rip when its raining,
shortgiraffes#1231,24-Jan-18 08:25 PM,socal weather,
Rye#0666,24-Jan-18 08:25 PM,It's LA bro,
thedragonlegacy#2854,24-Jan-18 08:25 PM,o,
Rye#0666,24-Jan-18 08:25 PM,Rains like three times a year,
thedragonlegacy#2854,24-Jan-18 08:25 PM,bro i didn't kno,
8726andrew#5709,24-Jan-18 08:25 PM,lol ga has actual seasons gl with that,
shortgiraffes#1231,24-Jan-18 08:25 PM,if its cold people either find a classroom or vestibule to eat in,
shortgiraffes#1231,24-Jan-18 08:25 PM,or just sit outside,
thedragonlegacy#2854,24-Jan-18 08:25 PM,PMS seasons you mean,
Rye#0666,24-Jan-18 08:25 PM,Have fun with humidity,
Rye#0666,24-Jan-18 08:25 PM,Especially if your hair gets in shambles from it like mine,
Rye#0666,24-Jan-18 08:26 PM,"It's not bad that I have short hair now but when it was longer, it was really annoying",
shortgiraffes#1231,24-Jan-18 08:26 PM,ha yeah I'm really looking forward to having seasons,
shortgiraffes#1231,24-Jan-18 08:26 PM,yikes my hair is really long right now,
shortgiraffes#1231,24-Jan-18 08:26 PM,about halfway down my back XD,
8726andrew#5709,24-Jan-18 08:26 PM,not when its 16 in the morning and the high is 31,
shortgiraffes#1231,24-Jan-18 08:26 PM,I mean,
8726andrew#5709,24-Jan-18 08:27 PM,its not like that happened like for a week over winter break,
shortgiraffes#1231,24-Jan-18 08:27 PM,"I've been *in* snow before, but not while it was snowing",
8726andrew#5709,24-Jan-18 08:27 PM,its not like i froze to death for like 2 weeks straight,
shortgiraffes#1231,24-Jan-18 08:27 PM,so I still kinda look forward to it,
8726andrew#5709,24-Jan-18 08:27 PM,it doesnt snow often,
shortgiraffes#1231,24-Jan-18 08:28 PM,I would rather be cold than boiling hot really overall though,
8726andrew#5709,24-Jan-18 08:28 PM,maybe once every 2 years if you're lucky,
shortgiraffes#1231,24-Jan-18 08:28 PM,"like cold makes you stiff but you can just wear layers, whereas heat makes you want to die and you can't do anything if you dont have A/C",
shortgiraffes#1231,24-Jan-18 08:28 PM,which I don't at home,
shortgiraffes#1231,24-Jan-18 08:29 PM,"our tactic during the summer is to open every window in the house until about 9 am, then close the house and do our best not to let the hot air in the rest of the day",
MEE6#4876,24-Jan-18 08:29 PM,"GG @shortgiraffes#1231, you just advanced to level 5!",
8726andrew#5709,24-Jan-18 08:29 PM,lol if you open windows around here you just get destroyed by bugs,
shortgiraffes#1231,24-Jan-18 08:29 PM,screens?,
thedragonlegacy#2854,24-Jan-18 08:29 PM,do you have screens on your windows sir,
8726andrew#5709,24-Jan-18 08:29 PM,not anymore,
8726andrew#5709,24-Jan-18 08:30 PM,also never open windows bc a/c,
thedragonlegacy#2854,24-Jan-18 08:30 PM,yeah,
thedragonlegacy#2854,24-Jan-18 08:30 PM,my mom doesnt like a/c in the house,
thedragonlegacy#2854,24-Jan-18 08:30 PM,in the summer,
Rye#0666,24-Jan-18 08:30 PM,Yeah screens are necessary if you don't want bugs,
8726andrew#5709,24-Jan-18 08:31 PM,lol what,
8726andrew#5709,24-Jan-18 08:31 PM,how,
8726andrew#5709,24-Jan-18 08:31 PM,a/c is a godsend,
shortgiraffes#1231,24-Jan-18 08:31 PM,are minimum day bc of heat a thing anywhere else? bc they are in my district,
8726andrew#5709,24-Jan-18 08:31 PM,minimum day?,
shortgiraffes#1231,24-Jan-18 08:32 PM,like in early october we had 3 minimum days district wide bc it was about 105 outside I think,
shortgiraffes#1231,24-Jan-18 08:32 PM,and a lot of the schools dont have AC,
shortgiraffes#1231,24-Jan-18 08:32 PM,so I guess they considered it like a safety thing? But it applied to schools that had AC too which was kinda stupid,
shortgiraffes#1231,24-Jan-18 08:33 PM,and yeah minimum day as in you get out early,
shortgiraffes#1231,24-Jan-18 08:33 PM,like instead of school being over at 340 its done at 210,
8726andrew#5709,24-Jan-18 08:33 PM,it usually doesn't get hot enough and everything has ac,
8726andrew#5709,24-Jan-18 08:33 PM,it can affect sports tho,
8726andrew#5709,24-Jan-18 08:33 PM,mostly just fall sports tho bc it doesnt get hot enough in the spring,
shortgiraffes#1231,24-Jan-18 08:33 PM,"PE classes/sports arent allowed to do outdoor activities if its over 95, I know that for sure",
shortgiraffes#1231,24-Jan-18 08:34 PM,but no this was a school and district wide thing,
thedragonlegacy#2854,24-Jan-18 08:34 PM,"lol my mother can't really handle cold weather that well bc of arthritis. and she grew up in malaysia, which is 90-100 degree weather",
shortgiraffes#1231,24-Jan-18 08:35 PM,aw thats too bad about the arthritis,
shortgiraffes#1231,24-Jan-18 08:35 PM,are you in state marissa?,
thedragonlegacy#2854,24-Jan-18 08:35 PM,"yeah, I am",
thedragonlegacy#2854,24-Jan-18 08:36 PM,XD my parents met on the internet back in the late 90's,
shortgiraffes#1231,24-Jan-18 08:36 PM,(also do you say muh-REE-suh or muh-riss-uh bc I know ppl named both and in my head I'm not sure what to call you lol),
shortgiraffes#1231,24-Jan-18 08:36 PM,(or some other way?),
shortgiraffes#1231,24-Jan-18 08:37 PM,hey nice the age of sketchy chat rooms before people were smart enough to not believe everything on the internet lol,
shortgiraffes#1231,24-Jan-18 08:37 PM,but glad it worked out for them,
thedragonlegacy#2854,24-Jan-18 08:37 PM,muh-riss-uh,
thedragonlegacy#2854,24-Jan-18 08:37 PM,;>,
thedragonlegacy#2854,24-Jan-18 08:37 PM,my mother says the same thing,
thedragonlegacy#2854,24-Jan-18 08:37 PM,she was in malaysia and my dad in the us,
thedragonlegacy#2854,24-Jan-18 08:38 PM,they would call each other and stuff,
thedragonlegacy#2854,24-Jan-18 08:38 PM,apparently my dad spent a lot of money on phone bills LOL bc of it,
shortgiraffes#1231,24-Jan-18 08:40 PM,ha thats pretty cute though,
8726andrew#5709,24-Jan-18 08:42 PM,lmao,

thedragonlegacy#2854,24-Jan-18 08:43 PM,she told him the price for the plane ticket in Malaysia's currency (ringets),
thedragonlegacy#2854,24-Jan-18 08:43 PM,and neglected to convert,
thedragonlegacy#2854,24-Jan-18 08:43 PM,on purpose,

Rye#0666,24-Jan-18 08:43 PM,Aww,
8726andrew#5709,24-Jan-18 08:44 PM,why?,
8726andrew#5709,24-Jan-18 08:44 PM,seems kinda odd,
8726andrew#5709,24-Jan-18 08:44 PM,thats sketchy af tho,
8726andrew#5709,24-Jan-18 08:45 PM,"people do scams where they send money so they can ""come visit"" and then they just keep it",
Rye#0666,24-Jan-18 08:45 PM,My parents met because my dad owned a restaurant and my mom was a waitress there,
Rye#0666,24-Jan-18 08:45 PM,She apparently hated him at first lol,
8726andrew#5709,24-Jan-18 08:45 PM,oof,
8726andrew#5709,24-Jan-18 08:45 PM,my parents met at a bar,
thedragonlegacy#2854,24-Jan-18 08:46 PM,idk my mom was quite the explorational creature,
thedragonlegacy#2854,24-Jan-18 08:47 PM,XD that sounds like a teen romance story on wattpad @Rye#0666,
Rye#0666,24-Jan-18 08:47 PM,Who said I didn't make it up?,
thedragonlegacy#2854,24-Jan-18 08:47 PM,x--x did you,
Rye#0666,24-Jan-18 08:47 PM,Maybe it's my teen romance novel I'm writing,
8726andrew#5709,24-Jan-18 08:47 PM,ooh,

shortgiraffes#1231,24-Jan-18 09:27 PM,"but between school load, work, extracirriculars, and trying to more than 6 hours of sleep a night it hasnt really been happening lately",
shortgiraffes#1231,24-Jan-18 09:27 PM,a shame because I love ficition in general but there are so many books on my to-read list,

Rye#0666,24-Jan-18 09:36 PM,Does anyone know if we need to submit a mid-year transcript?,

im an embarrassment#5212,25-Jan-18 08:10 PM,does it look bad if I write about switching my major,
8726andrew#5709,25-Jan-18 08:11 PM,what prompt,
im an embarrassment#5212,25-Jan-18 08:11 PM,what will you contribute to gt,
Rye#0666,25-Jan-18 08:11 PM,I haven't started mine,
im an embarrassment#5212,25-Jan-18 08:11 PM,like if i mention it at the beginning,
8726andrew#5709,25-Jan-18 08:12 PM,how is that relevant to what you'd contribute at gt tho,
8726andrew#5709,25-Jan-18 08:12 PM,im not saying dont do it,
8726andrew#5709,25-Jan-18 08:12 PM,just make it relevant,
im an embarrassment#5212,25-Jan-18 08:12 PM,i want to focus on what I can offer under that new major,
Raj#6135,25-Jan-18 08:12 PM,"I mean it shouldn't because I also believe I will be switching my major to Computer Science, but it might not be relevant",
Raj#6135,25-Jan-18 08:12 PM,"in that case, if u can make it relevant, i would say go for it",
im an embarrassment#5212,25-Jan-18 08:12 PM,"mmkay, thanks!",
Raj#6135,25-Jan-18 08:13 PM,yeah don't worry about it I'm writing the essay as we speak LOL,
Raj#6135,25-Jan-18 08:15 PM,"Speaking of, does anyone know how we go about changing majors?",
8726andrew#5709,25-Jan-18 08:15 PM,cant do it until spring semester,
8726andrew#5709,25-Jan-18 08:15 PM,i know that,
Raj#6135,25-Jan-18 08:15 PM,yeah that's what i thought,
im an embarrassment#5212,25-Jan-18 08:20 PM,"first change should be relatively easy tho, no questions asked",
Raj#6135,25-Jan-18 08:21 PM,"yeah it's just like tbh, i hope that i dont have to take classes I dont end up needing to",
MEE6#4876,25-Jan-18 08:21 PM,"GG @Raj#6135, you just advanced to level 2!",
im an embarrassment#5212,25-Jan-18 08:21 PM,yeah me too lol,
Alfred Borden#6177,25-Jan-18 08:23 PM,Thriving in a major might not be the best way to contribute,
Alfred Borden#6177,25-Jan-18 08:24 PM,"On campus activities: extracurriculars, clubs, initiatives,",
Alfred Borden#6177,25-Jan-18 08:24 PM,Plans for college,
Alfred Borden#6177,25-Jan-18 08:24 PM,Ambition,
Alfred Borden#6177,25-Jan-18 08:24 PM,Things like that,
Alfred Borden#6177,25-Jan-18 08:24 PM,"If you don’t have it I wouldn’t fake it, but scholarships go to those type of people",
lerk1#6965,25-Jan-18 08:26 PM,Totally agree,
Raj#6135,25-Jan-18 08:26 PM,"I agree you're right, but I'm sure she could write about how in a different major she can do more in the sense of major-related ec's , etc",
Raj#6135,25-Jan-18 08:27 PM,"however, i would still fake it till ya make it because i'd rather take a chance at not having debt",
8726andrew#5709,25-Jan-18 08:27 PM,dont lie on the app lol,
MEE6#4876,25-Jan-18 08:27 PM,"GG @8726andrew#5709, you just advanced to level 13!",
Raj#6135,25-Jan-18 08:29 PM,"yeah I don't encourage her to straight up lie, but I wouldn't just abandon all hope of the app you know?",
Raj#6135,25-Jan-18 08:30 PM,of course don't lie cause that would just end up doing more harm than anything else,
8726andrew#5709,25-Jan-18 08:31 PM,well yeah dont just give up lol,
Raj#6135,25-Jan-18 08:31 PM,yeah exactly i agree,
8726andrew#5709,25-Jan-18 08:31 PM,sometimes you just gotta make some adjustments,
8726andrew#5709,25-Jan-18 08:31 PM,sometimes you just cross out your whole essay and start over,
8726andrew#5709,25-Jan-18 08:31 PM,sometimes its just a paragraph,
lerk1#6965,25-Jan-18 08:32 PM,I’m not gonna have debt,
supremeavenger#3061,25-Jan-18 08:33 PM,me too probably @lerk1#6965,
im an embarrassment#5212,25-Jan-18 08:35 PM,oh no I wrote about encouraging women to take up stem,
Raj#6135,25-Jan-18 08:38 PM,what major do you intend on switching to?,
im an embarrassment#5212,25-Jan-18 08:40 PM,industrial engineering,
Raj#6135,25-Jan-18 08:41 PM,oh that's cool i've always been interested in that but not as much as cs,
lerk1#6965,25-Jan-18 09:02 PM,Me too,
im an embarrassment#5212,25-Jan-18 09:07 PM,they ask for your gpa on a 4.0 scale but my school only reports out of 100,
im an embarrassment#5212,25-Jan-18 09:08 PM,:blobthinkingdown:,
8726andrew#5709,25-Jan-18 09:08 PM,when tons of people have gpas of like 4.9 and your school only goes to 4.0 🤔,
arechawla#3188,25-Jan-18 09:08 PM,same,
KyotoKoto#5113,25-Jan-18 09:09 PM,"it might be out of 4.0 but that doesn’t take into account weighted grades (points for ap/DE, etc)",
thedragonlegacy#2854,25-Jan-18 09:10 PM,i give unweighted gpas because i'm lazy to calculate my weighted ;-;,
im an embarrassment#5212,25-Jan-18 09:10 PM,but seriously how the hell do i report this,
im an embarrassment#5212,25-Jan-18 09:11 PM,am i allowed a rough estimate?,
KyotoKoto#5113,25-Jan-18 09:12 PM,i couldn’t be bothered to calculate my gpa on 4.0 scale so i gave my DE gpa lol  which isn’t technically a lie so,
KyotoKoto#5113,25-Jan-18 09:12 PM,¯\_(ツ)_/¯,
im an embarrassment#5212,25-Jan-18 09:12 PM,I'll give them my HOPE gpa screw it,
Raj#6135,25-Jan-18 09:23 PM,HOPE?,
KyotoKoto#5113,25-Jan-18 09:24 PM,GA scholarship that funds all/part of your tuition,
Raj#6135,25-Jan-18 09:26 PM,ah i see,
lerk1#6965,25-Jan-18 09:27 PM,Haha,
Lennox#3038,25-Jan-18 09:32 PM,Be warned: The scholarship application has a section at the very end where you have to list out all your extracurriculars. Don't get caught off guard submitting the last minute,

Alfred Borden#6177,25-Jan-18 10:13 PM,@lerk1#6965 not bad. Because of you’re family’s financial conditions?,
lerk1#6965,25-Jan-18 10:14 PM,@Alfred Borden#6177 not exactly. I don’t really want to go into it here. Hit my dms,
Alfred Borden#6177,25-Jan-18 10:14 PM,Ok,
Alfred Borden#6177,25-Jan-18 10:14 PM,Curious bc you can afford a house near the school,
lerk1#6965,25-Jan-18 10:15 PM,It’s weird. I’ll  explain it in dms,
Alfred Borden#6177,25-Jan-18 10:45 PM,Ok,

suyashr99#7560,26-Jan-18 09:59 PM,\,
Lennox#3038,26-Jan-18 09:59 PM,Applying for scholarships remind me of those sketchy survey websites,
Lennox#3038,26-Jan-18 10:00 PM,It's always an oddly specific demographic they're going for,
8726andrew#5709,26-Jan-18 10:26 PM,the company stuff makes sense to me,
8726andrew#5709,26-Jan-18 10:26 PM,but like some of them are weird,
8726andrew#5709,26-Jan-18 10:26 PM,like for being tall or red haired or whatever,

lerk1#6965,27-Jan-18 09:21 PM,I don’t @Alfred Borden#6177,
Alfred Borden#6177,27-Jan-18 09:21 PM,That’s a touch cynical..,

Quantum#1480,27-Jan-18 09:22 PM,I didn't get an email today,
Quantum#1480,27-Jan-18 09:23 PM,I might've missed something important,
lerk1#6965,27-Jan-18 09:23 PM,I got a shit ton of money from gt too,
Alfred Borden#6177,27-Jan-18 09:24 PM,@Quantum#1480 I got notified by someone I’m in contact with at GT,
MEE6#4876,27-Jan-18 09:24 PM,"GG @Alfred Borden#6177, you just advanced to level 6!",
Alfred Borden#6177,27-Jan-18 09:24 PM,You will find out in a week,
Quantum#1480,27-Jan-18 09:24 PM,What will I find out?,
lerk1#6965,27-Jan-18 09:24 PM,I’m going to pay about 13k a year for tuition plus the house fees,
Alfred Borden#6177,27-Jan-18 09:24 PM,Whether ur a finalist,
Quantum#1480,27-Jan-18 09:24 PM,um,
Alfred Borden#6177,27-Jan-18 09:24 PM,That’s solid @lerk1#6965,
Quantum#1480,27-Jan-18 09:24 PM,You need to interview first,
Alfred Borden#6177,27-Jan-18 09:25 PM,"Yes, I did by video conference already",
Quantum#1480,27-Jan-18 09:26 PM,It says interviews are held nationwide February 10th,
Quantum#1480,27-Jan-18 09:26 PM,And that there are no exceptions at all,
Alfred Borden#6177,27-Jan-18 09:27 PM,Where?,
Lennox#3038,27-Jan-18 09:27 PM,http://stampsps.gatech.edu/images/pdf/Selection_Timeline_2018.pdf,
MEE6#4876,27-Jan-18 09:27 PM,"GG @Lennox#3038, you just advanced to level 6!",
lerk1#6965,27-Jan-18 09:28 PM,The letter he sent me looked real,
lerk1#6965,27-Jan-18 09:28 PM,Maybe he got an early interview idk,
Quantum#1480,27-Jan-18 09:29 PM,they never sent a letter though?,
Cactusman#3162,27-Jan-18 09:29 PM,I don't think they make exceptions,
Quantum#1480,27-Jan-18 09:29 PM,And yeah they clearly said no exceptions,
Alfred Borden#6177,27-Jan-18 09:29 PM,Email,
Alfred Borden#6177,27-Jan-18 09:29 PM,And I’m connected with the people making decisions,
Quantum#1480,27-Jan-18 09:29 PM,screenshot?,
lerk1#6965,27-Jan-18 09:30 PM,The email,
Cactusman#3162,27-Jan-18 09:30 PM,yes please,
lerk1#6965,27-Jan-18 09:30 PM,Idk if it’s real,
Alfred Borden#6177,27-Jan-18 09:30 PM,I find it offensive that I’m being asked to prove that I got a scholarship,
Quantum#1480,27-Jan-18 09:30 PM,Mainly because what you're saying doesn't line up with what they've said to literally everyone else,
Cactusman#3162,27-Jan-18 09:31 PM,why did you send it to lerk,
Cactusman#3162,27-Jan-18 09:31 PM,and no one else,
Alfred Borden#6177,27-Jan-18 09:31 PM,"He clearly harassed me for it, so I sent it to him.",
Alfred Borden#6177,27-Jan-18 09:31 PM,This server feels off,
Alfred Borden#6177,27-Jan-18 09:32 PM,I’m done,
Cactusman#3162,27-Jan-18 09:34 PM,okay,
8726andrew#5709,27-Jan-18 09:36 PM,uh alright,
8726andrew#5709,27-Jan-18 09:38 PM,tbf it looks like things don't line up,

thedragonlegacy#2854,03-Feb-18 10:48 PM,changing a tire on the hwy is scary tho. I had to do it with my dad once,
thedragonlegacy#2854,03-Feb-18 10:49 PM,it was at night too,
8726andrew#5709,03-Feb-18 10:49 PM,My dad claims my car has a spare tire but I’m pretty sure it doesn’t,
8726andrew#5709,03-Feb-18 10:49 PM,So I’m hoping I don’t ever have a flat,
8726andrew#5709,03-Feb-18 10:50 PM,Although that’s not the biggest issue with the car lmao,
Rye#0666,03-Feb-18 10:52 PM,My dad thought mine didn't so he bought a spare but it turns out that there was a spare in the trunk,
thedragonlegacy#2854,03-Feb-18 11:11 PM,2 spare or not 2 spare,
8726andrew#5709,03-Feb-18 11:11 PM,¯\_(ツ)_/¯,

8726andrew#5709,03-Feb-18 11:15 PM,"What the fuck did you just fucking say about me, you little bitch? I’ll have you know I graduated top of my class in the Chipotle Academy, and I’ve been involved in numerous secret raids on Moe’s, and I have over 300 confirmed wraps. I am trained in tortilla warfare and I’m the top griller in the entire chain of Chipotle Mexican Grills. You are nothing to me but just another customer. I will wipe your hunger the fuck out with precision the likes of which has never been seen before on this Earth, mark my fucking words. You think you can get away with saying that shit to me over the sneeze guard? Think again, fucker. As we speak I am contacting my secret network of Chipotle chefs across the USA and your IP is being traced right now so you better prepare for the storm, maggot. The storm that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call your appetite. You’re fucking full, kid. I can be anywhere, anytime, and I can feed you in over seven hundred ways, and that’s just with my bare hands. Not only am I extensively trained in bowl-based combat, but I have access to the entire arsenal of the Chipotle workforce, and I will use it to its full extent to wipe your miserable hunger off the face of the continent, you little shit. If only you could have known what unholy retribution your little “clever” comment was about to bring down upon you, maybe you would have held your fucking tongue. But you couldn’t, you didn’t, and now you’re paying the upcharge, you goddamn idiot. I will scoop guac all over you and you will drown in it. You’re double wrapped, kiddo.",

Lennox#3038,04-Feb-18 10:34 PM,wondering if tech even requires two econ classes for those majors,
Chafos#1781,04-Feb-18 10:47 PM,I know I haven't taken either of those,
Arya201#6452,04-Feb-18 10:48 PM,Yo,
Chafos#1781,04-Feb-18 10:48 PM,I don't really see how economics has much relevance to comp sci or engineering unless you as a computer scientist or engineer choose to apply your skills in that field,
KyotoKoto#5113,04-Feb-18 10:52 PM,"@Lennox#3038 i self studied micro/macro and took the respective ap exams last year for shits and giggles, it’s definitely doable. i took a nap during after MC and pulled through with a 4 on each, and i didn’t really know what was going on so you should be fine if you go through with it , , in regards to if you need those classes, i believe there’s a list of all the required courses (you need in order to graduate) that’s found on their website somewhere",

Chafos#1781,04-Feb-18 10:57 PM,it really looks like for comp e you only need like 1 or 2 econ electives,
Chafos#1781,04-Feb-18 10:57 PM,so that's all you would be getting out of,
Chafos#1781,04-Feb-18 10:57 PM,and I don't even see anything about it for comp sci,

Chafos#1781,04-Feb-18 11:01 PM,yes I saw that too,
Chafos#1781,04-Feb-18 11:01 PM,so I guess if you want to get out of that then the macro or micro exam would be worth it,
Chafos#1781,04-Feb-18 11:03 PM,or if you genuinely enjoy economics you could also just take it for that,

arechawla#3188,05-Feb-18 08:13 PM,I really hope ATL gets it. Austin also has a really big tech scene tho...,
Rye#0666,05-Feb-18 08:13 PM,Only problem I'd see is infrastructure,
Rye#0666,05-Feb-18 08:13 PM,I think they want something farther east,
Thedarkbobman#8576,05-Feb-18 08:13 PM,maybe boston or philly then,
arechawla#3188,05-Feb-18 08:13 PM,Yeah that's true,
Rye#0666,05-Feb-18 08:14 PM,MARTA is pretty meh compared to similarly sized cities,
thedragonlegacy#2854,05-Feb-18 08:14 PM,can you imagine? HQ is a lot of openings. Where else are they going to source jobs except internal migration and local workers. Companies are going to loose good employees,
Rye#0666,05-Feb-18 08:14 PM,I think DC has a good shot since Amazon is becoming increasingly powerful and they'd probably want to be near Congress,
Rye#0666,05-Feb-18 08:15 PM,Plus Jeff Bezos owns the Washington Post,
HM04#1608,05-Feb-18 08:18 PM,Austin is too small for an amazon hub imo,

Lennox#3038,05-Feb-18 08:30 PM,"""The efforts to lure the tech giant to town have been both big and creative, from sending a giant cactus to CEO Jeff Bezos to offering big tax breaks. A Georgia town even said it would de-annex some of its land and name it the city of Amazon.""",

Rye#0666,07-Feb-18 06:20 AM,I remember in middle school I wanted to go to NYU because my dad went there and I liked New York,
Lordbobby104#0879,07-Feb-18 09:34 AM,I’ve wanted to go since seventh grade,

Chafos#1781,07-Feb-18 11:54 AM,was basically just hoping to get in somewhere,
Lordbobby104#0879,07-Feb-18 12:29 PM,I fell in love with programming and I'm an in state student so Georgia Tech was like the first choice,

Snowfish#4289,07-Feb-18 05:44 PM,watching people from out of state/the country suffer through the summer,
Lennox#3038,07-Feb-18 05:45 PM,I imagine louisiana won't be much of a shift though,
Lennox#3038,07-Feb-18 05:46 PM,Anyone here coming from the northeast?,
thedragonlegacy#2854,07-Feb-18 05:48 PM,"ah yes... here, we enjoy our afternoons with refined choking on 100% humidity",

Raj#6135,07-Feb-18 05:52 PM,ugh,
Lennox#3038,07-Feb-18 05:52 PM,it has its perks though,
Lennox#3038,07-Feb-18 05:52 PM,oftentimes if I get thirsty I just wave a towel in the air then wring it out,
Snowfish#4289,07-Feb-18 05:52 PM,rofl,
thedragonlegacy#2854,07-Feb-18 05:57 PM,XD,
thedragonlegacy#2854,07-Feb-18 05:58 PM,don't forget,
thedragonlegacy#2854,07-Feb-18 05:58 PM,that the sweat sticks to your body,
thedragonlegacy#2854,07-Feb-18 05:58 PM,it doesnt evaporate... no... it just clings,
Rye#0666,07-Feb-18 05:58 PM,Yep,
Raj#6135,07-Feb-18 05:59 PM,...,
Snowfish#4289,07-Feb-18 05:59 PM,i had to walk like 15 minutes across campus today and i felt like i had been swimming,
Raj#6135,07-Feb-18 05:59 PM,im afraid of the south,
Rye#0666,07-Feb-18 05:59 PM,That's why extreme humidity can be bad for you,
Snowfish#4289,07-Feb-18 05:59 PM,you probably should be,
Raj#6135,07-Feb-18 05:59 PM,"well i mean, in the northeast today, it just snowed 4 inches in 2 hours so that happened",
Rye#0666,07-Feb-18 05:59 PM,"If the sweat can't evaporate, your body can't cool down",
Lennox#3038,07-Feb-18 05:59 PM,Our winters will be tropical to you though,
Lennox#3038,07-Feb-18 05:59 PM,might not even need to bring a coat,
Snowfish#4289,07-Feb-18 05:59 PM,seriously,
Snowfish#4289,07-Feb-18 05:59 PM,it was like 65 today,
Snowfish#4289,07-Feb-18 06:00 PM,with high humidity and rain,
thedragonlegacy#2854,07-Feb-18 06:00 PM,ugh when it rains tho,
thedragonlegacy#2854,07-Feb-18 06:00 PM,smh,
thedragonlegacy#2854,07-Feb-18 06:00 PM,if you're outside after it rains in the summer,
Rye#0666,07-Feb-18 06:00 PM,I heard thunder and saw a flash of lightning in the shower this morning,
thedragonlegacy#2854,07-Feb-18 06:00 PM,smh,
Rye#0666,07-Feb-18 06:00 PM,It spooked me,
thedragonlegacy#2854,07-Feb-18 06:00 PM,might as well breathe water,
Raj#6135,07-Feb-18 06:01 PM,does it ever even snow down there,
Raj#6135,07-Feb-18 06:01 PM,like ever,
thedragonlegacy#2854,07-Feb-18 06:01 PM,yeah... you'll find it really funny,
thedragonlegacy#2854,07-Feb-18 06:01 PM,because ppl can't drive in the snow,
Raj#6135,07-Feb-18 06:01 PM,do schools close with like 1 inch of snow,
Snowfish#4289,07-Feb-18 06:01 PM,i had an exam the last time it snowed,
thedragonlegacy#2854,07-Feb-18 06:01 PM,"depends, but ya so far",
Raj#6135,07-Feb-18 06:01 PM,......,
Snowfish#4289,07-Feb-18 06:01 PM,took me an hour and a half to drive less than a mile,
Snowfish#4289,07-Feb-18 06:01 PM,xd,
Snowfish#4289,07-Feb-18 06:02 PM,i twas like a quarter inch,
Rye#0666,07-Feb-18 06:02 PM,Traffic was so bad this morning going to school,
Raj#6135,07-Feb-18 06:02 PM,"4 inches of snow today and my school was just like "" oh yeah you have the AMC today, eh just ride a snowmobile to school or something""",
Rye#0666,07-Feb-18 06:02 PM,I live only half a mile away and it took me almost 20 minutes,
Rye#0666,07-Feb-18 06:02 PM,I was almost late to my 1st period,
Raj#6135,07-Feb-18 06:02 PM,"whenever it snows for us, our first period just doesnt care about attendance bc driving here becomes impossible",
Rye#0666,07-Feb-18 06:02 PM,But they were letting people come in late without passes so it wouldn't have mattered,
thedragonlegacy#2854,07-Feb-18 06:03 PM,"georgia isn't equipped to deal with snow, let's just say that",
Snowfish#4289,07-Feb-18 06:03 PM,snowpocalypse,
Rye#0666,07-Feb-18 06:03 PM,Indeed,
Raj#6135,07-Feb-18 06:03 PM,time to reroute a blizzard down to Georgia,
Raj#6135,07-Feb-18 06:03 PM,how we do it idk but i wanna c what happens,
thedragonlegacy#2854,07-Feb-18 06:03 PM,yes please,
Rye#0666,07-Feb-18 06:03 PM,Georgia dies when there's snow,
Snowfish#4289,07-Feb-18 06:03 PM,a blizzard in GA would actually shut down the state,
thedragonlegacy#2854,07-Feb-18 06:03 PM,we would fall off the map,
Raj#6135,07-Feb-18 06:04 PM,"there was this really bad winter once like 4 years ago, we got 2 feet of snow, and like things were just normal it was so freaky",
Snowfish#4289,07-Feb-18 06:04 PM,"i think the most snow ive seen in GA was like, what, 4 inches",
Snowfish#4289,07-Feb-18 06:04 PM,?,
thedragonlegacy#2854,07-Feb-18 06:04 PM,"i think that was when we also had a bad winter, around 4 yrs ago",
thedragonlegacy#2854,07-Feb-18 06:04 PM,had 1000+ accidents in one night,
thedragonlegacy#2854,07-Feb-18 06:04 PM,kids in buses stuck on the road overnight,

supremeavenger#3061,07-Feb-18 06:05 PM,this recent snow was pretty hefty,
Lennox#3038,07-Feb-18 06:05 PM,^,
Raj#6135,07-Feb-18 06:05 PM,nj is weird bc we have winters like these and summers of 100+ degrees and it's just like what.,
Lennox#3038,07-Feb-18 06:05 PM,great tromping snow,
Raj#6135,07-Feb-18 06:05 PM,but the idea of humidity scares me,
thedragonlegacy#2854,07-Feb-18 06:05 PM,i actually can't deal with dry heat/arizona/las vegas. been so used to ga climate that it dries me up,
Quantum#1480,07-Feb-18 06:06 PM,I feel like Georgias been getting better with snow,
thedragonlegacy#2854,07-Feb-18 06:06 PM,you mean in response?,
Quantum#1480,07-Feb-18 06:06 PM,Yeah,
Quantum#1480,07-Feb-18 06:06 PM,The state dealt with the 10 inches a couple weeks ago fairly well,
thedragonlegacy#2854,07-Feb-18 06:07 PM,it helps that d-days exists so we don't have to make school days up,
Quantum#1480,07-Feb-18 06:07 PM,I find it funny Gwinnett calls then d-days,
Raj#6135,07-Feb-18 06:08 PM,what is this,

thedragonlegacy#2854,07-Feb-18 06:08 PM,they close school and force us to do online work,

Snowfish#4289,07-Feb-18 06:13 PM,i just lived like 45 minutes away my freshman/sophomore year so i never bothered getting involved with anything,
Snowfish#4289,07-Feb-18 06:13 PM,cuz nobody could ever pick me up that often,

Lennox#3038,07-Feb-18 06:17 PM,What's special about the school?,
thedragonlegacy#2854,07-Feb-18 06:17 PM,...,
Snowfish#4289,07-Feb-18 06:17 PM,it's a charter school that basically puts a bunch of kids through college for 4 years,
Snowfish#4289,07-Feb-18 06:18 PM,"needlessly stupid assignments and hard tests/classes so mcuh that by the time you get to college and professors pull shit, you don't even care anymore",
Snowfish#4289,07-Feb-18 06:18 PM,i sound angry but it was actually pretty legit,
Thedarkbobman#8576,07-Feb-18 06:18 PM,seems intense,
Snowfish#4289,07-Feb-18 06:19 PM,just someone in the administration was a sadist,
Thedarkbobman#8576,07-Feb-18 06:19 PM,:monkaMEGA:,
thedragonlegacy#2854,07-Feb-18 06:19 PM,would you have preferred to attend a different school instead of gsmst after going through it?,
Snowfish#4289,07-Feb-18 06:19 PM,no,
thedragonlegacy#2854,07-Feb-18 06:19 PM,curious,
Snowfish#4289,07-Feb-18 06:20 PM,"honestly, after it's all said and done, i gained so much from it that i would do it again in a heartbeat, all the bullshit bus rides included",
Thedarkbobman#8576,07-Feb-18 06:20 PM,how many kids did they send to the  top schools,
Snowfish#4289,07-Feb-18 06:20 PM,i know we had like 10% of our class go to GT,
thedragonlegacy#2854,07-Feb-18 06:20 PM,"currently, i heard that 80+ ppl from gsmst got accepted to tech EA",
Snowfish#4289,07-Feb-18 06:21 PM,even more now,
Snowfish#4289,07-Feb-18 06:21 PM,"we had a ton of transfers, i'd say like 30-40% of my graduating class is here",
Thedarkbobman#8576,07-Feb-18 06:21 PM,wow,
Lennox#3038,07-Feb-18 06:21 PM,impressive,
Snowfish#4289,07-Feb-18 06:21 PM,granted my graduating class was 200 people,
thedragonlegacy#2854,07-Feb-18 06:21 PM,graduating class is around 200 now i tink?,
thedragonlegacy#2854,07-Feb-18 06:21 PM,ye,
Snowfish#4289,07-Feb-18 06:22 PM,its impressive that 80 got in tho,
Snowfish#4289,07-Feb-18 06:22 PM,we only had like 15 people get EA in my class,
thedragonlegacy#2854,07-Feb-18 06:22 PM,i can't say its accurate but that's what i heard ¯\_(ツ)_/¯,
Thedarkbobman#8576,07-Feb-18 06:22 PM,i am in pa and me and my friends are convinced Penn hates my school,
Snowfish#4289,07-Feb-18 06:23 PM,maybe,
Snowfish#4289,07-Feb-18 06:23 PM,admissions offices are werid,
thedragonlegacy#2854,07-Feb-18 06:24 PM,maybe the principal spilled coffee on the head admission person and now you all are doomed,
Thedarkbobman#8576,07-Feb-18 06:24 PM,our acceptance rate to penn is like 2% lower that their overall,
Thedarkbobman#8576,07-Feb-18 06:24 PM,which is 9%,
Thedarkbobman#8576,07-Feb-18 06:24 PM,and we have really smart people in our school,
Snowfish#4289,07-Feb-18 06:24 PM,damn penn is that low?,
Snowfish#4289,07-Feb-18 06:24 PM,rip my cousin going there,
Thedarkbobman#8576,07-Feb-18 06:25 PM,the only people who really get in from our school are legacy ed,
thedragonlegacy#2854,07-Feb-18 06:25 PM,ya penn is a top school,
Thedarkbobman#8576,07-Feb-18 06:25 PM,^,

thedragonlegacy#2854,07-Feb-18 06:25 PM,they're really top in sports too,
Snowfish#4289,07-Feb-18 06:25 PM,that'll do it,
Snowfish#4289,07-Feb-18 06:25 PM,i never looked out of georgia cuz zell and i dont like debt,
Thedarkbobman#8576,07-Feb-18 06:25 PM,penn medicine is amazing as well,
Thedarkbobman#8576,07-Feb-18 06:25 PM,i think everyone who applied to wharton so far got denied,
sophie#9067,07-Feb-18 06:26 PM,i mean if most people apply to wharton that's probably why your school's acceptance rates are lower,
Thedarkbobman#8576,07-Feb-18 06:26 PM,and most of the others got deferred,
Thedarkbobman#8576,07-Feb-18 06:26 PM,i wouldnt say most,
sophie#9067,07-Feb-18 06:26 PM,bc wharton acceptances are way lower than overall penn i think,
Thedarkbobman#8576,07-Feb-18 06:26 PM,like i know a dude with good stats and ecs who has legacy and applied engineering,
Thedarkbobman#8576,07-Feb-18 06:26 PM,who did ed,
Thedarkbobman#8576,07-Feb-18 06:26 PM,and then got deferred,
Snowfish#4289,07-Feb-18 06:26 PM,that's why you apply as a gender studies major and then switch to business :EZ:,
thedragonlegacy#2854,07-Feb-18 06:26 PM,XD,
sophie#9067,07-Feb-18 06:26 PM,engineering is harder .....,
sophie#9067,07-Feb-18 06:26 PM,bRo,
Thedarkbobman#8576,07-Feb-18 06:26 PM,"like mom, dad, grandfather went to penn",
Thedarkbobman#8576,07-Feb-18 06:26 PM,not at penn lmao,
Thedarkbobman#8576,07-Feb-18 06:26 PM,wharton is so much harder to get into,
sophie#9067,07-Feb-18 06:27 PM,omfg it's a penn family,
Thedarkbobman#8576,07-Feb-18 06:27 PM,yeah and he got deferred,
Thedarkbobman#8576,07-Feb-18 06:27 PM,tho he is probably getting in rd,
Snowfish#4289,07-Feb-18 06:27 PM,that fucking sucks for him,
sophie#9067,07-Feb-18 06:27 PM,sad life wtf,
Snowfish#4289,07-Feb-18 06:27 PM,i imagine the pressure is on,
Snowfish#4289,07-Feb-18 06:27 PM,he has my condolences,
Thedarkbobman#8576,07-Feb-18 06:28 PM,"to put the ""penn hates our school"" into context",
Thedarkbobman#8576,07-Feb-18 06:28 PM,last year our cornell acceptance rate was like 27%,
Snowfish#4289,07-Feb-18 06:29 PM,put this in context for someone who doesnt know acceptance rates too pls,
Thedarkbobman#8576,07-Feb-18 06:29 PM,their overall is like 14%,
Snowfish#4289,07-Feb-18 06:29 PM,oh daymn,
Thedarkbobman#8576,07-Feb-18 06:29 PM,yep,
Snowfish#4289,07-Feb-18 06:29 PM,pretty sure GT hated my school too,
Snowfish#4289,07-Feb-18 06:29 PM,we had 2 kids get straight rejected from GT and both of them got full scholarships to MIT,
Thedarkbobman#8576,07-Feb-18 06:29 PM,wtf,
sophie#9067,07-Feb-18 06:29 PM,LOL,
Thedarkbobman#8576,07-Feb-18 06:30 PM,what even,
Thedarkbobman#8576,07-Feb-18 06:30 PM,i wish i had that problem lmao,
Snowfish#4289,07-Feb-18 06:30 PM,was pretty fucking hilarious,
MEE6#4876,07-Feb-18 06:30 PM,"GG @Snowfish#4289, you just advanced to level 9!",
sophie#9067,07-Feb-18 06:30 PM,i mean i think uga rejects some people that they think are applying to them as safety,
Thedarkbobman#8576,07-Feb-18 06:30 PM,mit is like a meme for us,
sophie#9067,07-Feb-18 06:30 PM,maybe tech did the same thing??,
Thedarkbobman#8576,07-Feb-18 06:30 PM,no one gets in,
Snowfish#4289,07-Feb-18 06:30 PM,well,
Thedarkbobman#8576,07-Feb-18 06:30 PM,i think two years ago two people got in,
Snowfish#4289,07-Feb-18 06:30 PM,they were both indian males applying to CS,
Thedarkbobman#8576,07-Feb-18 06:30 PM,nothing after that,
Thedarkbobman#8576,07-Feb-18 06:30 PM,WHAT,
Snowfish#4289,07-Feb-18 06:30 PM,i think they got demographic'd,
Thedarkbobman#8576,07-Feb-18 06:31 PM,how tf,
Thedarkbobman#8576,07-Feb-18 06:31 PM,do you get rejected from gt and get into mit as an indian male,
Thedarkbobman#8576,07-Feb-18 06:31 PM,for cs,
Snowfish#4289,07-Feb-18 06:31 PM,good question,
sophie#9067,07-Feb-18 06:31 PM,this yr two people from my school have gotten into mit for ea,
Thedarkbobman#8576,07-Feb-18 06:31 PM,as an indian male this confuses me,
sophie#9067,07-Feb-18 06:31 PM,but no one ever really gets into mit from our school and,
Thedarkbobman#8576,07-Feb-18 06:31 PM,"my friend has a friend who got into penn ed, and mit the day after",
sophie#9067,07-Feb-18 06:31 PM,omfg,
Snowfish#4289,07-Feb-18 06:32 PM,owch.,
Thedarkbobman#8576,07-Feb-18 06:32 PM,"the guy is rich af and he managed to pull the ""i can't afford it card""",
thedragonlegacy#2854,07-Feb-18 06:32 PM,e_e mustbnice,
Snowfish#4289,07-Feb-18 06:32 PM,lol,
Thedarkbobman#8576,07-Feb-18 06:32 PM,so he is going to mit,
sophie#9067,07-Feb-18 06:32 PM,i wish i was smart,
sophiesacks#1153,07-Feb-18 06:32 PM,well damn guess I can’t have his spot,
shortgiraffes#1231,07-Feb-18 06:32 PM,Dang you guys go to really established high schools,
Rye#0666,07-Feb-18 06:32 PM,GT rejected my twin brother but accepted me :^),
Thedarkbobman#8576,07-Feb-18 06:32 PM,@sophiesacks#1153 ikr,
sophiesacks#1153,07-Feb-18 06:32 PM,I got deferred so I’m just here living,
Snowfish#4289,07-Feb-18 06:32 PM,:FeelsBadMan: for you brother.,
shortgiraffes#1231,07-Feb-18 06:32 PM,"Mine has only had one graduating class this far so I have no idea what our ""rates"" are for any top schools",
Thedarkbobman#8576,07-Feb-18 06:33 PM,it kinda sucks because no matter how good i am enough of my friends are better so that i wont get into mit,
sophie#9067,07-Feb-18 06:33 PM,oof,
Rye#0666,07-Feb-18 06:33 PM,He's going to UGA then transferring,
shortgiraffes#1231,07-Feb-18 06:33 PM,Though we did get 2 acceptances to Berkeley that I know of?,
Thedarkbobman#8576,07-Feb-18 06:33 PM,thats good,
Snowfish#4289,07-Feb-18 06:33 PM,@Thedarkbobman#8576 its ok dood GT is great xd,
Thedarkbobman#8576,07-Feb-18 06:33 PM,berkeley is hella expensive tho,
Thedarkbobman#8576,07-Feb-18 06:33 PM,ik,
Snowfish#4289,07-Feb-18 06:33 PM,MIT is also cold,
shortgiraffes#1231,07-Feb-18 06:33 PM,Yeah but we're in state,
shortgiraffes#1231,07-Feb-18 06:33 PM,For UCs,
Thedarkbobman#8576,07-Feb-18 06:33 PM,oh,
Thedarkbobman#8576,07-Feb-18 06:33 PM,still good,
Thedarkbobman#8576,07-Feb-18 06:33 PM,especially if its for cs,
sophie#9067,07-Feb-18 06:34 PM,i heard uc's are harder to get into from cali,
sophie#9067,07-Feb-18 06:34 PM,is that true???,
sophiesacks#1153,07-Feb-18 06:34 PM,berkeley is just hard to get into,
shortgiraffes#1231,07-Feb-18 06:34 PM,Uh one was biomed something and the other was electrical engineering but the engineering one chose UCSD instead actually,
Snowfish#4289,07-Feb-18 06:34 PM,"if i was a college, i'd also want 5x more tuition",
shortgiraffes#1231,07-Feb-18 06:34 PM,No idea but that sounds counterintuitive sophie,
8726andrew#5709,07-Feb-18 06:34 PM,Ryan's twin is not the same as him,
shortgiraffes#1231,07-Feb-18 06:34 PM,Since they're state public schools,
8726andrew#5709,07-Feb-18 06:35 PM,so its not terribly shocking that he got denied,
sophie#9067,07-Feb-18 06:35 PM,i rememver i was looking at acceptance rates,
sophie#9067,07-Feb-18 06:35 PM,and instate was like lower,
Thedarkbobman#8576,07-Feb-18 06:35 PM,my school is weird sometimes because people with really bad stats get into really good schools sometimes,
sophie#9067,07-Feb-18 06:35 PM,lmaoo,
Snowfish#4289,07-Feb-18 06:35 PM,might be more people applying from instate sophie,
shortgiraffes#1231,07-Feb-18 06:35 PM,That might be due to sheer number of oos applicants,
Thedarkbobman#8576,07-Feb-18 06:35 PM,like some person with a 99 weighted average got into mit,
shortgiraffes#1231,07-Feb-18 06:35 PM,Compared to in state maybe?,
Thedarkbobman#8576,07-Feb-18 06:35 PM,which is like,
sophie#9067,07-Feb-18 06:35 PM,omg ur smart @Snowfish#4289,
Thedarkbobman#8576,07-Feb-18 06:35 PM,not competitive at all at my school,
Rye#0666,07-Feb-18 06:35 PM,Yeah what Andrew said,
Rye#0666,07-Feb-18 06:35 PM,My brother is lazier than me,
8726andrew#5709,07-Feb-18 06:36 PM,he's a closet weeb too smh,
Rye#0666,07-Feb-18 06:36 PM,Lol yeah,
Snowfish#4289,07-Feb-18 06:37 PM,"this is purely anecdotal, but i'd assume a lot of people who dont have great grades are like ""yolo i live in cali ill just send my application there and see what happens"" whereas out of state students who apply to out of state schools are _generally_ a little bit more motivated/have better stats than the average instate",
Thedarkbobman#8576,07-Feb-18 06:37 PM,i would say that is probably true,
Thedarkbobman#8576,07-Feb-18 06:37 PM,which is also why our penn rate is probably lower,
sophie#9067,07-Feb-18 06:37 PM,kinda like uga huh,
Thedarkbobman#8576,07-Feb-18 06:37 PM,how good is uga?,
sophiesacks#1153,07-Feb-18 06:37 PM,I’m from ohio and that sounds very true,
Snowfish#4289,07-Feb-18 06:37 PM,like i personally know a ton of people from GA who just sent their application to GT even though they had like _solid_ 3.0 GPAs and sub 1800 SAT,
sophie#9067,07-Feb-18 06:37 PM,uhhh,
sophiesacks#1153,07-Feb-18 06:37 PM,people who apply are truly considering ucs,
sophie#9067,07-Feb-18 06:37 PM,its almost top 50 school,
Snowfish#4289,07-Feb-18 06:38 PM,UGA sucks 😡,
sophie#9067,07-Feb-18 06:38 PM,LOL,
Thedarkbobman#8576,07-Feb-18 06:38 PM,lmao,
Snowfish#4289,07-Feb-18 06:38 PM,im required to say this by GT law or i will be shot,
Snowfish#4289,07-Feb-18 06:38 PM,send help,
thedragonlegacy#2854,07-Feb-18 06:38 PM,i forgot to apply to uga lmao,
shortgiraffes#1231,07-Feb-18 06:38 PM,"@Snowfish#4289 you aren't wrong, we're strongly encouraged to apply to UCs and the district has a very big A-G req program to make sure you're elligible even with poor grades",
sophie#9067,07-Feb-18 06:38 PM,i didnt apply,
sophie#9067,07-Feb-18 06:38 PM,saparate application is too extra,
thedragonlegacy#2854,07-Feb-18 06:38 PM,^,
8726andrew#5709,07-Feb-18 06:38 PM,i hated uga when i went lol so i didn't bother,
8726andrew#5709,07-Feb-18 06:38 PM,my tour guides were shit so that didn't help,
Snowfish#4289,07-Feb-18 06:39 PM,i applied to UGA even though i knew i'd probably go to KSU over UGA,
sophie#9067,07-Feb-18 06:39 PM,Athens is lame too,
shortgiraffes#1231,07-Feb-18 06:39 PM,There is a level of desensitization to the UC influence simply due to be near them and hearing about them all the time,
sophie#9067,07-Feb-18 06:39 PM,ahh i ser,
Snowfish#4289,07-Feb-18 06:39 PM,makes sense,
Thedarkbobman#8576,07-Feb-18 06:39 PM,i applied to ucla and berkely but i wouldnt go even if i got in due to oos cost,
sophie#9067,07-Feb-18 06:39 PM,^^^^^,
Snowfish#4289,07-Feb-18 06:39 PM,california OOS cost :monkaS:,
8726andrew#5709,07-Feb-18 06:39 PM,just go to NYU what could go wrong,
Thedarkbobman#8576,07-Feb-18 06:39 PM,LOL,
sophie#9067,07-Feb-18 06:39 PM,LMAO,
8726andrew#5709,07-Feb-18 06:39 PM,not like its $289031823921 a year or anything,
shortgiraffes#1231,07-Feb-18 06:39 PM,Cost of living in California is insane,
Snowfish#4289,07-Feb-18 06:39 PM,NY OOS cost :monkaMEGA:,

sophie#9067,07-Feb-18 06:40 PM,nyu is private anyway,
shortgiraffes#1231,07-Feb-18 06:40 PM,I would be screwed,
Thedarkbobman#8576,07-Feb-18 06:40 PM,@8726andrew#5709 might want to do x10 that number,
Thedarkbobman#8576,07-Feb-18 06:40 PM,at least,
8726andrew#5709,07-Feb-18 06:40 PM,you right,
Rye#0666,07-Feb-18 06:40 PM,@Thedarkbobman#8576 UGA is a good school. Big party school. I liked the campus when I visited,
8726andrew#5709,07-Feb-18 06:40 PM,isnt it like 60k a year or some shit,
Snowfish#4289,07-Feb-18 06:40 PM,"my roommate wanted to go to NYU, i had to gently lay out that it would _literally_ be 100x more expensive to go there than GT",

sophie#9067,07-Feb-18 06:41 PM,my friend didnt get in,
8726andrew#5709,07-Feb-18 06:41 PM,ah rip,
sophie#9067,07-Feb-18 06:41 PM,then another person with wAAAY lower grades and sat get in,
Snowfish#4289,07-Feb-18 06:41 PM,saved herself a couple hundred thousand in debt,
Thedarkbobman#8576,07-Feb-18 06:41 PM,that happens at my school too,
sophie#9067,07-Feb-18 06:41 PM,;-;,
sophie#9067,07-Feb-18 06:41 PM,i dont understand,
8726andrew#5709,07-Feb-18 06:41 PM,could be an AA thing or a major thing,
Thedarkbobman#8576,07-Feb-18 06:41 PM,though usually with recruited athletes,
8726andrew#5709,07-Feb-18 06:41 PM,or that,
Snowfish#4289,07-Feb-18 06:41 PM,this is gonna be pretty not-PC but were they both the same gender/race?,
sophie#9067,07-Feb-18 06:41 PM,yeah,
Snowfish#4289,07-Feb-18 06:42 PM,and applying for the same major?,
sophie#9067,07-Feb-18 06:42 PM,idk about rhe other one's major but,
sophie#9067,07-Feb-18 06:42 PM,i do know stern is super super hard to get into,
sophie#9067,07-Feb-18 06:42 PM,so,

Snowfish#4289,07-Feb-18 06:42 PM,yea i feel,
Snowfish#4289,07-Feb-18 06:42 PM,also another big thing could possibly be first gen college students,
Snowfish#4289,07-Feb-18 06:43 PM,for some reason admissions offices jerk off over that stuff,
sophie#9067,07-Feb-18 06:43 PM,my friend is first gen,
sophie#9067,07-Feb-18 06:43 PM,so,

8726andrew#5709,07-Feb-18 06:43 PM,something shady must be going on,
8726andrew#5709,07-Feb-18 06:43 PM,if i had to guess most likely major related?,
sophie#9067,07-Feb-18 06:43 PM,yeah stern bsuiness,
Snowfish#4289,07-Feb-18 06:43 PM,either a) major related or b) the other person had a _really_ good essay,
8726andrew#5709,07-Feb-18 06:43 PM,theres some people i didn't expect to get in to GT at my school who got in i think for like business and stuff,
Snowfish#4289,07-Feb-18 06:43 PM,its also not like the same person does every application,
Snowfish#4289,07-Feb-18 06:43 PM,some people are simply more lenient than others,
Rye#0666,07-Feb-18 06:44 PM,^,
Rye#0666,07-Feb-18 06:44 PM,Depends on who's looking at your applications too,
thedragonlegacy#2854,07-Feb-18 06:44 PM,a lot of my school's EA acceptances weren't engineering,
sophie#9067,07-Feb-18 06:44 PM,omg Andrew im business majo r now in sad,
Snowfish#4289,07-Feb-18 06:44 PM,80% of the people in business are the laziest people ive ever met,
sophie#9067,07-Feb-18 06:44 PM,i feel discriminated against,
Snowfish#4289,07-Feb-18 06:44 PM,the other 20% are people who you just _know_ are going places,

thedragonlegacy#2854,07-Feb-18 06:44 PM,you should see the gt memes for business,
sophie#9067,07-Feb-18 06:44 PM,lmaoo,

Snowfish#4289,07-Feb-18 06:54 PM,within like the first 3 months it went from me playing games at reasonable times (I was fine with turning it off completely when she went to bed) to me not even being allowed to call my grandma at 2PM,
sophie#9067,07-Feb-18 06:54 PM,uhm,

Snowfish#4289,07-Feb-18 06:57 PM,at least i'd be able to talk to my grandma,
8726andrew#5709,07-Feb-18 06:58 PM,who needs a roommate when you have a house right,

Rye#0666,07-Feb-18 06:58 PM,Yikes,
sophie#9067,07-Feb-18 06:58 PM,i mean i gueds i could fail this year lmao,
Snowfish#4289,07-Feb-18 06:59 PM,"idk how someone can honestly take themselves seriously when their roommate is on the phone for less than a minute talking about soup recipes or some shit and they start basically yelling that they ""can't focus or study"" becuase you'r e""being too loud all the time""",
8726andrew#5709,07-Feb-18 06:59 PM,go to the fucking library then lmao,

sophie#9067,07-Feb-18 06:59 PM,ngl,
Snowfish#4289,07-Feb-18 06:59 PM,"she used to always love telling the RA's that ""she shouldn't have to get dressed and trek across campus because i can't 'shut up for 5 minutes'""",
Snowfish#4289,07-Feb-18 07:00 PM,anyway yes i can rant for a long time,
Rye#0666,07-Feb-18 07:00 PM,But Andrew that requires actually walking,
Snowfish#4289,07-Feb-18 07:00 PM,all i can say is make sure you all get ahead of your roommatees on befriending the RA's,
Snowfish#4289,07-Feb-18 07:00 PM,cuz if they turn out to be a psychopath its' a big RIP for you,
thedragonlegacy#2854,07-Feb-18 07:00 PM,😐,
Rye#0666,07-Feb-18 07:00 PM,Why be rational when you can just make things inconvienient for yourself and others?,
Snowfish#4289,07-Feb-18 07:01 PM,yup.,
sophie#9067,07-Feb-18 07:01 PM,you gotta be extra,
thedragonlegacy#2854,07-Feb-18 07:01 PM,ah yes... spend time calculating on how you should make other ppl's lives harder,
sophie#9067,07-Feb-18 07:01 PM,that's what life's about,
Thedarkbobman#8576,07-Feb-18 07:02 PM,^,
Snowfish#4289,07-Feb-18 07:02 PM,i mean her reasoning (that she eventually confessed to me) was that i was supposed to “be her friend” and i was “being a bad friend” by talking to anyone besides her,
Snowfish#4289,07-Feb-18 07:02 PM,which includes my lovely grandma,
sophie#9067,07-Feb-18 07:02 PM,huh,
Thedarkbobman#8576,07-Feb-18 07:02 PM,wow,
thedragonlegacy#2854,07-Feb-18 07:02 PM,what a fucking psycho,

Thedarkbobman#8576,07-Feb-18 07:02 PM,uh,
thedragonlegacy#2854,07-Feb-18 07:02 PM,sounds like a person who doesn't know how to operate the friendship wheel,
Lordbobby104#0879,07-Feb-18 07:03 PM,Very lovely,
Snowfish#4289,07-Feb-18 07:04 PM,avoid psychos in college guys,
Thedarkbobman#8576,07-Feb-18 07:04 PM,good advice,
Snowfish#4289,07-Feb-18 07:04 PM,can’t go wrong with that advice,
sophie#9067,07-Feb-18 07:04 PM,i think you would avoid in general,
thedragonlegacy#2854,07-Feb-18 07:04 PM,noted: watch out for socially inept ppl that deal w/ ppl by manipulating/controlling,
Snowfish#4289,07-Feb-18 07:05 PM,if y’all need any more roommate horror stories hmu,

sophie#9067,07-Feb-18 07:09 PM,probably right,
sophie#9067,07-Feb-18 07:09 PM,apparently ashwagandha is indian ginseng,
udishab#2211,07-Feb-18 07:11 PM,dang I hope I get a good roommate,
Lordbobby104#0879,07-Feb-18 07:12 PM,rt,
8726andrew#5709,07-Feb-18 07:15 PM,sometimes people hide the crazy tho,
8726andrew#5709,07-Feb-18 07:15 PM,so at first they'll cool and then 3 months in they go psycho,
8726andrew#5709,07-Feb-18 07:15 PM,makes it hard to tell,
Lennox#3038,07-Feb-18 07:16 PM,Sharing a tiny box with someone for an extended period of time sure brings out the worst in people,
Lennox#3038,07-Feb-18 07:17 PM,also why I don't plan to go to space anytime soon,
8726andrew#5709,07-Feb-18 07:17 PM,i mean i feel like being an astronaut is wildly different from being a college student,
8726andrew#5709,07-Feb-18 07:17 PM,just a little tho,
udishab#2211,07-Feb-18 07:18 PM,eh astronaut college student what's the difference,
Snowfish#4289,07-Feb-18 07:22 PM,"if i had to go to space with my roommate, we’d have our first intergalactic murder",

8726andrew#5709,08-Feb-18 09:35 PM,my motivation for not quitting is that coach would actually kill me,

8726andrew#5709,08-Feb-18 09:40 PM,but i'd probably have to run more in the 9:40s lol,
8726andrew#5709,08-Feb-18 09:40 PM,the 1600 is 4:23,
waffle.dynasty#2740,08-Feb-18 09:40 PM,good luck,

thedragonlegacy#2854,08-Feb-18 11:39 PM,well its not like i actually snap people anyways so,
thedragonlegacy#2854,08-Feb-18 11:39 PM,¯\_(ツ)_/¯,
8726andrew#5709,08-Feb-18 11:40 PM,oh and it stops being chronological sometimes when it feels like it,

arechawla#3188,09-Feb-18 01:49 PM,Question:,
arechawla#3188,09-Feb-18 01:49 PM,"When you send AP scores, do you send all of them? Or pick and choose",
arechawla#3188,09-Feb-18 01:50 PM,"My school got a grant this year where if you get 3+ on any STEM exam, they give you $100 per exam",
arechawla#3188,09-Feb-18 01:51 PM,So I'm retaking some APs like APES. If I get a 3 in apes will they overlook it or void my previous score of a 4?,
Rye#0666,09-Feb-18 01:52 PM,Send all of them,
Rye#0666,09-Feb-18 01:52 PM,They'll probably take the higher score,
arechawla#3188,09-Feb-18 01:52 PM,Even if the lower one is most recent?,
Rye#0666,09-Feb-18 01:53 PM,I'd say so,
MEE6#4876,09-Feb-18 01:53 PM,"GG @Rye#0666, you just advanced to level 15!",
arechawla#3188,09-Feb-18 01:53 PM,"Like I'm taking the ab exam for that ez cash but if I somehow end up with like a 3, I don't want it to void previous score",
Rye#0666,09-Feb-18 01:53 PM,But just make sure,
arechawla#3188,09-Feb-18 01:53 PM,Alright,
arechawla#3188,09-Feb-18 01:53 PM,Yeah,

udishab#2211,09-Feb-18 06:00 PM,paying to take AP exams must suck tho,
Rye#0666,09-Feb-18 06:03 PM,"Get good grades, get paid",
Cloud No. 10#2997,09-Feb-18 06:13 PM,at my school you have to pay to take them and each test is $90,
arechawla#3188,09-Feb-18 06:14 PM,we also used to have to pay 90 per exam,
arechawla#3188,09-Feb-18 06:14 PM,this year we got a grant,

kk4jrq#5652,09-Feb-18 06:26 PM,"We are required to take them, but they at least pay for them",
shortgiraffes#1231,09-Feb-18 07:10 PM,At mine you pay $15 per test but when you show up to take it you get $10 back,
shortgiraffes#1231,09-Feb-18 07:10 PM,Since the district covers it and all they want to make sure you aren't wasting their money I guess,
Raj#6135,09-Feb-18 07:44 PM,wtf,
Raj#6135,09-Feb-18 07:44 PM,we pay a 100 per test,
Rye#0666,09-Feb-18 07:49 PM,The first AP test is paid for us,

Thedarkbobman#8576,15-Feb-18 08:46 PM,idk about you but i am having my own party at my house with my french email hw that is due tomorrow 👌,
Raj#6135,15-Feb-18 08:47 PM,oh u see,
Raj#6135,15-Feb-18 08:47 PM,i have winter break now,
Raj#6135,15-Feb-18 08:47 PM,from tmrw till tuesday,
Raj#6135,15-Feb-18 08:47 PM,"so uh as of rn, what is this hw u speak of?",
Thedarkbobman#8576,15-Feb-18 08:47 PM,winter break lmao,
Thedarkbobman#8576,15-Feb-18 08:48 PM,my teachers went on strike a while back,
Thedarkbobman#8576,15-Feb-18 08:48 PM,so we lost like 3 school days,
Thedarkbobman#8576,15-Feb-18 08:48 PM,that we have to make up,
Thedarkbobman#8576,15-Feb-18 08:48 PM,ALSO,
Thedarkbobman#8576,15-Feb-18 08:48 PM,apparently the district wasn't meeting the mandatory day requirement anyways so when the state checked up on them bcs of the strike,
Thedarkbobman#8576,15-Feb-18 08:48 PM,ez more days on top of the days we missed,
Thedarkbobman#8576,15-Feb-18 08:48 PM,so break is a foreign concept rn,
supremeavenger#3061,15-Feb-18 08:49 PM,is this Georgia @Thedarkbobman#8576?,
Thedarkbobman#8576,15-Feb-18 08:49 PM,nah,
Thedarkbobman#8576,15-Feb-18 08:49 PM,PA,
supremeavenger#3061,15-Feb-18 08:50 PM,makes sense,
supremeavenger#3061,15-Feb-18 08:50 PM,i was a little confused because Georgia teachers cant really go on strike because there are no teachers unions here,
Thedarkbobman#8576,15-Feb-18 08:50 PM,wow,
Thedarkbobman#8576,15-Feb-18 08:50 PM,i think my teachers are all part of like 3 unions,
Thedarkbobman#8576,15-Feb-18 08:50 PM,"local, state, and national",
thedragonlegacy#2854,15-Feb-18 09:08 PM,haha we don’t know what unions are in Georgia,
supremeavenger#3061,15-Feb-18 09:29 PM,tbh im not sure if its actually a bad thing,
supremeavenger#3061,15-Feb-18 09:29 PM,i've asked my teachers about it before and most of them seem to be ok with it,
thedragonlegacy#2854,15-Feb-18 09:36 PM,about not having a union?,
8726andrew#5709,15-Feb-18 09:39 PM,unions can be good and bad,
8726andrew#5709,15-Feb-18 09:40 PM,like sometimes you're forced into doing things a certain way or whatever,
8726andrew#5709,15-Feb-18 09:40 PM,but without them sometimes you get treated like shit with nothing you can really do,
thedragonlegacy#2854,15-Feb-18 11:12 PM,I wonder how much unions will affect amazon’s hq decision,
Thedarkbobman#8576,15-Feb-18 11:13 PM,depends on what the majority of the employees are,
Thedarkbobman#8576,15-Feb-18 11:13 PM,like if its all execs/programmers or other such jobs i dont think it would impact it too much,
Thedarkbobman#8576,15-Feb-18 11:13 PM,unless there is an exec or programmer union i havent heard of,
thedragonlegacy#2854,15-Feb-18 11:18 PM,I wonder how Amazon structures their workforce,
thedragonlegacy#2854,15-Feb-18 11:18 PM,Time for some googling,
kk4jrq#5652,15-Feb-18 11:20 PM,"It's probably ridiculous... Their workforce is in constant flux cuz like Christmas is insanity, but February is not as bad",
kk4jrq#5652,15-Feb-18 11:20 PM,And like technically whole foods employees are Amazon workforce so........,
thedragonlegacy#2854,15-Feb-18 11:32 PM,apparently amazon’s profit took a $60 mil loss,
Thedarkbobman#8576,15-Feb-18 11:32 PM,doesnt not surprise me,
Thedarkbobman#8576,15-Feb-18 11:32 PM,they are all about the long term,
thedragonlegacy#2854,15-Feb-18 11:33 PM,"they plan to cut 1300 employees, and are closing a warehouse facility in Georgia",
Thedarkbobman#8576,15-Feb-18 11:34 PM,what type of employees?,
thedragonlegacy#2854,15-Feb-18 11:34 PM,and going through some “restructuring”.,
Quantum#1480,15-Feb-18 11:34 PM,Yeah a lot of these huge companies routinely take losses,
Quantum#1480,15-Feb-18 11:35 PM,The biggest examples I can think of are Tesla and Snap,
Thedarkbobman#8576,15-Feb-18 11:35 PM,i figure a company like amazon that is diversifying itself and is investing in new tech would cut jobs that aren't worth keeping for non financial trouble reaasons,
Thedarkbobman#8576,15-Feb-18 11:35 PM,def tesla,
kk4jrq#5652,15-Feb-18 11:36 PM,Amazon is actually designed not to make a profit... It is pretty crazy but they are set to break even,
kk4jrq#5652,15-Feb-18 11:36 PM,They do make losses/profit but in the net long run the plan is to break even,
Thedarkbobman#8576,15-Feb-18 11:36 PM,after a certain point that break even would be after massive investment that would be well worth it,
Quantum#1480,15-Feb-18 11:37 PM,"well their long term plan is to grow marketshare, of which breaking even is the result",
Quantum#1480,15-Feb-18 11:37 PM,Because any profit should be put back into growth,
Thedarkbobman#8576,15-Feb-18 11:37 PM,which is one great way to pay less taxes as well,
kk4jrq#5652,15-Feb-18 11:38 PM,Not really cuz taxes are revenue based not profit... :PepeHands:,
thedragonlegacy#2854,15-Feb-18 11:39 PM,"“Amazon.com Inc. is cutting hundreds of jobs at its headquarters in Seattle, paring back older departments focused on selling goods online while hiring in newer lines of business like cloud computing and its Alexa platform., , , The reductions are part of a broader reorganization at the company, but some see the moves as a shift toward using more robots and computers for functions once performed by humans”",
Thedarkbobman#8576,15-Feb-18 11:39 PM,i always though it was on profit,
Thedarkbobman#8576,15-Feb-18 11:39 PM,that makes perfect sense and is totally something amazon would do,
kk4jrq#5652,15-Feb-18 11:40 PM,I mean all companies should be doing it...,
Thedarkbobman#8576,15-Feb-18 11:40 PM,just because they should doesnt mean they do lmao,
thedragonlegacy#2854,15-Feb-18 11:40 PM,"Definitely, if they’re in for the long term",
kk4jrq#5652,15-Feb-18 11:40 PM,Menial tasks should go to machines.  Human brains need to do the more creative work,
thedragonlegacy#2854,15-Feb-18 11:43 PM,I wanted to find some information about how they organize their locations/people,
thedragonlegacy#2854,15-Feb-18 11:45 PM,"like I know State Farm is going through “restructuring” and moving towards keeping teams located in the same location, and sectioning different hubs for specific types of tech dev",
thedragonlegacy#2854,15-Feb-18 11:46 PM,"ugh I’m not near my laptop, it’s a pain to type on my phone ;~~;",
thedragonlegacy#2854,15-Feb-18 11:46 PM,"But yeah, im curious about amazons organization of employees",

Arya201#6452,16-Feb-18 12:38 PM,Like after switching?,
kk4jrq#5652,16-Feb-18 12:39 PM,You just take core classes your first semester,
kk4jrq#5652,16-Feb-18 12:39 PM,Or you take more hours than you probably should 2nd,

Rye#0666,16-Feb-18 02:46 PM,You're taking most of the same core classes,
Arya201#6452,16-Feb-18 04:24 PM,MechE,
Rye#0666,16-Feb-18 04:38 PM,Switching won't be a big deal for you,
Rye#0666,16-Feb-18 04:38 PM,Especially switching between engineering majors,
Rye#0666,16-Feb-18 04:38 PM,You have to take a lot of the same core classes,
Arya201#6452,16-Feb-18 04:42 PM,Yeah just talked to a senior earlier today.,
Arya201#6452,16-Feb-18 04:42 PM,She said the same thing pretty much.,
Arya201#6452,16-Feb-18 04:42 PM,A bit of a relief tbh,
8726andrew#5709,16-Feb-18 07:37 PM,Be glad you aren’t trying to switch colleges,
8726andrew#5709,16-Feb-18 07:37 PM,Iirc when you apply you get into the college you applied to not the entire school itsself,
8726andrew#5709,16-Feb-18 07:37 PM,"Like college of engineering, college of lib arts etc",
supremeavenger#3061,17-Feb-18 12:54 AM,Not sure if that's true @8726andrew#5709,
supremeavenger#3061,17-Feb-18 12:55 AM,Tons of people switch from hard engineering majors to business iirc,
8726andrew#5709,17-Feb-18 09:13 AM,That’s what an advisor for ME told me,
8726andrew#5709,17-Feb-18 09:14 AM,"Specifically, she said that you get into the college not the school",

arechawla#3188,17-Feb-18 10:48 AM,Anyone going to the GaTech math competition?,
Snowfish#4289,17-Feb-18 12:08 PM,"it is very, very easy to switch majors",
Snowfish#4289,17-Feb-18 12:08 PM,i’m pretty sure the most you have to do is attend a session where they go “ok this major is VERY HARD GUYS it’s not a JOKE ok here’s a little flier have a nice day”,
Snowfish#4289,17-Feb-18 12:08 PM,unless you’re on like academic probation,
Snowfish#4289,17-Feb-18 12:09 PM,GT is awful about scheduling so they’ll just load up a major willy nilly,
MooshRum#3936,17-Feb-18 12:40 PM,@8726andrew#5709 Or you can apply to the Liberal Arts college and then switch to engineerings,
Raj#6135,17-Feb-18 01:20 PM,"Lol im transferring the other way around, engineering to computer science",

thedragonlegacy#2854,19-Feb-18 12:40 AM,#whentechisntaliberalartsschool 🙏🏼,
thedragonlegacy#2854,19-Feb-18 12:40 AM,I’m not looking forward to classes being ruled by political bias,
Snowfish#4289,19-Feb-18 12:40 AM,lots of really awkward guys that are suuuuper desperate/think any contact with a girl is a sign of interest >.>,
Snowfish#4289,19-Feb-18 12:41 AM,"btw, ps: ""what did you get for question 3 on the homework"" does not mean ""lets bang""",
Snowfish#4289,19-Feb-18 12:41 AM,pretty much every intro english class has some sort of political/social bias,
8726andrew#5709,19-Feb-18 12:41 AM,oh,
8726andrew#5709,19-Feb-18 12:42 AM,i was thinking maybe it was a little more than that and i could sorta see it,
8726andrew#5709,19-Feb-18 12:42 AM,but oh noooo,
Snowfish#4289,19-Feb-18 12:42 AM,ive literally asked a dude what he got for a homework problem and he asked if i wanted to come back to his apartment... lol,
thedragonlegacy#2854,19-Feb-18 12:42 AM,Uh...... lol,
Snowfish#4289,19-Feb-18 12:43 AM,yeaaaah,
thedragonlegacy#2854,19-Feb-18 12:43 AM,thirsty,
8726andrew#5709,19-Feb-18 12:43 AM,i mean what could possibly go wrong,
Snowfish#4289,19-Feb-18 12:44 AM,i've had lots of people argue with professors but that's not really that bad,
Snowfish#4289,19-Feb-18 12:44 AM,"its just like ""oh boy here we go""",
Snowfish#4289,19-Feb-18 12:44 AM,especially in my philosophy class,
Snowfish#4289,19-Feb-18 12:44 AM,"my professor was a baller tho and would just shut everyone the fuck down, which was pretty funny",
Snowfish#4289,19-Feb-18 12:46 AM,"anyway, moral of the story is there are people much more cringe than danton/whatever his name is at GT :FeelsBadMan:",
thedragonlegacy#2854,19-Feb-18 12:47 AM,"yo who is that professor, imma try to snag a class",
Rye#0666,19-Feb-18 12:48 AM,Yikes,
Chafos#1781,19-Feb-18 12:56 AM,and I thought I was an awkward introvert,
Chafos#1781,19-Feb-18 12:56 AM,seems like some people have it much worse,
thedragonlegacy#2854,19-Feb-18 01:19 AM,I was an awkward introvert in middle school. Now I’m an awkward outgoing introvert. Lol,
kk4jrq#5652,19-Feb-18 01:47 AM,I'm an introvert except for when I'm not which is totally unpredictable,

Arya201#6452,19-Feb-18 10:01 AM,GT has spoiled me,
Arya201#6452,19-Feb-18 10:01 AM,I wasn't like this.,
Arya201#6452,19-Feb-18 10:02 AM,Smh,

thedragonlegacy#2854,19-Feb-18 10:02 AM,Lol really? 😂😂😂 I put minimal effort first semester,
kk4jrq#5652,19-Feb-18 10:02 AM,But of course AP exams are a thing so I can't give up,
thedragonlegacy#2854,19-Feb-18 10:02 AM,Even more minimal effort now,
Arya201#6452,19-Feb-18 10:02 AM,I worked hard all my life but then GT happened,
Arya201#6452,19-Feb-18 10:03 AM,Lmao I don't have APs,
kk4jrq#5652,19-Feb-18 10:03 AM,Dude I was working so hard until Tech happened and now I'm like meh.  I'd rather read or do other things than do HW,
Arya201#6452,19-Feb-18 10:03 AM,😂 😂,
thedragonlegacy#2854,19-Feb-18 10:03 AM,Ya... college acceptance does deter motivation toward HS classes,
kk4jrq#5652,19-Feb-18 10:03 AM,Half my classes are a joke anywars,
thedragonlegacy#2854,19-Feb-18 10:03 AM,I wish I dual enrolled instead 😤😤,
thedragonlegacy#2854,19-Feb-18 10:03 AM,So I wouldn’t be wasting my time,
kk4jrq#5652,19-Feb-18 10:03 AM,Me too... AP is just a slaughterhouse,
Arya201#6452,19-Feb-18 10:04 AM,Ok so I studied moat of my life but after getting accepted I think I've just given up. Do A2 results count?,
Arya201#6452,19-Feb-18 10:04 AM,Is our offer at GT conditional?,
kk4jrq#5652,19-Feb-18 10:04 AM,Just don't fail anything and you'll be fine,
kk4jrq#5652,19-Feb-18 10:04 AM,Yes it's conditional,
Arya201#6452,19-Feb-18 10:04 AM,😱 😱,
kk4jrq#5652,19-Feb-18 10:04 AM,But seriously just do halfway decent and you'll be fine,
thedragonlegacy#2854,19-Feb-18 10:04 AM,They’re allowed to take back their offer of acceptance lol,
Arya201#6452,19-Feb-18 10:05 AM,Oh shit that's no good 😱 😱,
kk4jrq#5652,19-Feb-18 10:05 AM,Yep if you just quit school 2nd semester and fail classes,
Arya201#6452,19-Feb-18 10:05 AM,Like what's the condition,
kk4jrq#5652,19-Feb-18 10:05 AM,But as long as you keep like A's and B's should be no worries.,
Arya201#6452,19-Feb-18 10:05 AM,Ok I won't fail the second semester,
thedragonlegacy#2854,19-Feb-18 10:05 AM,So don’t COMPLETELY blow off your classes,
thedragonlegacy#2854,19-Feb-18 10:05 AM,A little hiccup is ok,

Arya201#6452,19-Feb-18 10:06 AM,No AP grade at all 🙄 🙄,
thedragonlegacy#2854,19-Feb-18 10:06 AM,AP lit is a joke this year,
kk4jrq#5652,19-Feb-18 10:07 AM,AP Lit is killing me.........,
thedragonlegacy#2854,19-Feb-18 10:07 AM,Since it’s an online class for me. The teacher kinda gave up on ap teaching,
angrymunch739#7866,19-Feb-18 10:07 AM,Lol,
kk4jrq#5652,19-Feb-18 10:07 AM,Our teacher just believes in Shakespeare and I HATE shakespeare,

Arya201#6452,19-Feb-18 10:08 AM,That's like safer,
Arya201#6452,19-Feb-18 10:08 AM,But A2?,
kk4jrq#5652,19-Feb-18 10:08 AM,They have to get your final grades eventually... That's part of the conditions,
Arya201#6452,19-Feb-18 10:08 AM,Oh shit how to undo time and start studying from January 14th?,
thedragonlegacy#2854,19-Feb-18 10:08 AM,Have no clue about A2. Call Tech or email them and ask,

Arya201#6452,19-Feb-18 10:09 AM,Lmfao,

Arya201#6452,19-Feb-18 10:09 AM,Think its time to move to deep talk room,
thedragonlegacy#2854,19-Feb-18 10:10 AM,lmao we be not deep yet,
Arya201#6452,19-Feb-18 10:10 AM,Life is a joke isn't it deep enough 😰 😰,
Arya201#6452,19-Feb-18 10:10 AM,Also how to undo time,
kk4jrq#5652,19-Feb-18 10:10 AM,Life is like a circle...,
Arya201#6452,19-Feb-18 10:10 AM,This is bad.,
Arya201#6452,19-Feb-18 10:11 AM,I'm getting anxiety attacks tbh,
kk4jrq#5652,19-Feb-18 10:11 AM,We are all excited to go to tech and hate high school,
Arya201#6452,19-Feb-18 10:11 AM,Yeah Jordan,
kk4jrq#5652,19-Feb-18 10:11 AM,But we will all go to tech and hate tech and be excited to get jobs,
Arya201#6452,19-Feb-18 10:11 AM,True true,
kk4jrq#5652,19-Feb-18 10:11 AM,It never ends...,
Arya201#6452,19-Feb-18 10:11 AM,And then we get jobs and plan retirement,
thedragonlegacy#2854,19-Feb-18 10:11 AM,¯\_(ツ)_/¯,
Arya201#6452,19-Feb-18 10:11 AM,After retirement we want to be kids again,
Arya201#6452,19-Feb-18 10:11 AM,But...,
Arya201#6452,19-Feb-18 10:11 AM,We die,
kk4jrq#5652,19-Feb-18 10:11 AM,I hope Tech is at least somewhat better than HS...,
kk4jrq#5652,19-Feb-18 10:11 AM,At least we will have free time,
thedragonlegacy#2854,19-Feb-18 10:12 AM,A lot more freedom,
Arya201#6452,19-Feb-18 10:12 AM,My HS was shit tbh,
kk4jrq#5652,19-Feb-18 10:12 AM,Same,
thedragonlegacy#2854,19-Feb-18 10:12 AM,"If you stay on campus, you can be more involved",

thedragonlegacy#2854,19-Feb-18 10:13 AM,I enjoyed my HS 😁 only bc we had a program that wants to reform the olden standard school structure,
Arya201#6452,19-Feb-18 10:13 AM,Mine was bad bad,
thedragonlegacy#2854,19-Feb-18 10:13 AM,o?,
Arya201#6452,19-Feb-18 10:13 AM,Bunker ditched 3/4th of the classes,

thedragonlegacy#2854,19-Feb-18 10:16 AM,“No gossip”😂 you’re a spicy one,
Arya201#6452,19-Feb-18 10:18 AM,Definately,
thedragonlegacy#2854,19-Feb-18 10:18 AM,I’ve been tryna stay away from gossip throughout hs,
Arya201#6452,19-Feb-18 10:18 AM,I need gossip to breath 😂 😂,
Arya201#6452,19-Feb-18 10:19 AM,I try not to be the gossip myself tho lmao,
kk4jrq#5652,19-Feb-18 10:23 AM,Come to my school... It's so small gossip spreads like wildfire,
kk4jrq#5652,19-Feb-18 10:23 AM,Everyone knows everyone so that only makes matters worse,
Arya201#6452,19-Feb-18 10:25 AM,I know everyone at school. It's not tiny trust me,
Arya201#6452,19-Feb-18 10:26 AM,"But then again there's NO GOSSIP, NO DRAMA HERE.",
8726andrew#5709,19-Feb-18 10:31 AM,Lol most of the drama I know about is all the band kids,

Arya201#6452,19-Feb-18 02:30 PM,That's not humane,
Chafos#1781,19-Feb-18 02:31 PM,"6 am really isn't that bad, I can't talk though I set my alarm for 6 and I get up at 6:10,6:20, and then for real at 6:30",

Arya201#6452,19-Feb-18 02:34 PM,And there's birds at 4am,
Arya201#6452,19-Feb-18 02:34 PM,It's not dead silent,

Snowfish#4289,19-Feb-18 03:24 PM,"some professors are absolute dogshit teachers, so i just read the textbook",
Snowfish#4289,19-Feb-18 03:24 PM,why bother wasting an hour listening to someone drone on about shit that i could learn better in 10 minutes of reading,
arechawla#3188,19-Feb-18 04:52 PM,What happens if you skip class and they give like a pop quiz or something... are you just screwed? or is there a way to make it up,
BradfordOfMars#9837,19-Feb-18 05:08 PM,usually just screwed unless you have an actual excuse that most professors require go through the Dean of Students office,
BradfordOfMars#9837,19-Feb-18 05:09 PM,but it totally depends on the professor as well,
Snowfish#4289,19-Feb-18 05:11 PM,they don’t really do pop quizzes,
dogrocker321#8836,19-Feb-18 05:26 PM,I just personally wouldn’t be that selfish to my parents,
BradfordOfMars#9837,19-Feb-18 05:26 PM,well it's not really all about your parents since they aren't gonna be here,
BradfordOfMars#9837,19-Feb-18 05:27 PM,and there are some classes where it really is a waste of time to go,
BradfordOfMars#9837,19-Feb-18 05:28 PM,like CHEM 1211K with Dr. Perry is literally him reading the other professor's powerpoint slides word for word and he doesn't explain anything,
BradfordOfMars#9837,19-Feb-18 05:29 PM,"so I haven't been since the first week, read the powerpoints in a tenth of the time, and get a perfect score on the first test",
dogrocker321#8836,19-Feb-18 05:29 PM,I disagree,
dogrocker321#8836,19-Feb-18 05:29 PM,My parents are helping pay for my education,
BradfordOfMars#9837,19-Feb-18 05:30 PM,"well it certainly is up to your definition of ""wasting money"" too",
dogrocker321#8836,19-Feb-18 05:30 PM,I’m not gonna skip classes,
8726andrew#5709,19-Feb-18 05:30 PM,Hey man it’s your life,
dogrocker321#8836,19-Feb-18 05:30 PM,I agree,
8726andrew#5709,19-Feb-18 05:30 PM,Idk why you’re acting like we’re telling you what to do lmao,
8726andrew#5709,19-Feb-18 05:30 PM,But if a teacher literally just reads off PowerPoints then yeah that’s a waste,
dogrocker321#8836,19-Feb-18 05:31 PM,I’m not. Just calling you guys selfish for skipping classes,
8726andrew#5709,19-Feb-18 05:31 PM,“I’m just being a dick”,
BradfordOfMars#9837,19-Feb-18 05:31 PM,"well when I pay for my own college education, I kind of get to make those choices",
dogrocker321#8836,19-Feb-18 05:31 PM,Ok it’s your choice to be irresponsible. Has nothing to do with me,
BradfordOfMars#9837,19-Feb-18 05:32 PM,"you're free to make your own choices and you surely aren't the only one who feels that way, but you don't really get to tell other people how to live their lives",
Snowfish#4289,19-Feb-18 05:32 PM,i pay out of pocket for my own education,
Snowfish#4289,19-Feb-18 05:32 PM,i guess i’m being selfish toward myself 🤔,
dogrocker321#8836,19-Feb-18 05:32 PM,I don’t really care,
dogrocker321#8836,19-Feb-18 05:32 PM,You’re just irresponsible,
Snowfish#4289,19-Feb-18 05:32 PM,ok cool,
Snowfish#4289,19-Feb-18 05:32 PM,message me again in 2 years and tell me you never skipped any classes,
Snowfish#4289,19-Feb-18 05:32 PM,i’ll give you a gold star,
dogrocker321#8836,19-Feb-18 05:32 PM,I will,
Snowfish#4289,19-Feb-18 05:33 PM,:OMEGALUL: sure you will,
8726andrew#5709,19-Feb-18 05:33 PM,Have you guys had any professors that require attendance?,
Snowfish#4289,19-Feb-18 05:33 PM,yeah,
Snowfish#4289,19-Feb-18 05:33 PM,usually 1-2 a semester,
Snowfish#4289,19-Feb-18 05:34 PM,those are always the classes that require the least attendance too,
Snowfish#4289,19-Feb-18 05:34 PM,like one of my professors literally posts recordings of all of the lectures online but still requires attendance,
dogrocker321#8836,19-Feb-18 05:34 PM,That’s how it should be,
Snowfish#4289,19-Feb-18 05:34 PM,like literally the same experience in class or at home but i gotta go all the way there 🤔,
8726andrew#5709,19-Feb-18 05:34 PM,Lol that’s how distance math is,
8726andrew#5709,19-Feb-18 05:34 PM,And we get all the notes too,
Snowfish#4289,19-Feb-18 05:35 PM,it’s annoying,
dogrocker321#8836,19-Feb-18 05:35 PM,I can imagine. Actually going to class in college must be very annoying,
Snowfish#4289,19-Feb-18 05:36 PM,honestly dude if you’re just gonna be a prick all day i’ll just ban you,
dogrocker321#8836,19-Feb-18 05:36 PM,Power hungry tyrant,

8726andrew#5709,19-Feb-18 05:37 PM,Yeah he’s not too great at hiding it,
8726andrew#5709,19-Feb-18 05:37 PM,Well they I suppose,

Snowfish#4289,20-Feb-18 11:55 AM,although sometiems its easier to go through certain buildings to get where you want to go,
Snowfish#4289,20-Feb-18 11:55 AM,"i was lost as fuck until i actually moved in, once you have that point of ""home"" it's super fast learning where everything is, since you just kinda learn where shit is relative to where you live",

udishab#2211,21-Feb-18 11:24 PM,aww omg from what i hear people use it at tech at least lol,
thedragonlegacy#2854,21-Feb-18 11:24 PM,I’m glad. Slack is more professional,
thedragonlegacy#2854,21-Feb-18 11:24 PM,They used it at HackGT for coms,
Thedarkbobman#8576,21-Feb-18 11:25 PM,i just had to lick a tootsie pop and count how many it took to get to the center for my stat hw,
Thedarkbobman#8576,21-Feb-18 11:25 PM,i got like 411 licks,
Thedarkbobman#8576,21-Feb-18 11:25 PM,starting from the shorter end,
Curole#1878,21-Feb-18 11:25 PM,I would just put around 500 tbh,
Curole#1878,21-Feb-18 11:26 PM,would  not actually do it,
thedragonlegacy#2854,21-Feb-18 11:28 PM,omg 😂 how long did it take?,
Thedarkbobman#8576,21-Feb-18 11:29 PM,like 7 min,
Thedarkbobman#8576,21-Feb-18 11:29 PM,wasn't going too fast tho,

Thedarkbobman#8576,21-Feb-18 11:32 PM,so you know how there is a ring on it right,
Thedarkbobman#8576,21-Feb-18 11:33 PM,i just need to go from edge to the ring,
Thedarkbobman#8576,21-Feb-18 11:33 PM,stopping when i hit the tootsie part,
thedragonlegacy#2854,21-Feb-18 11:34 PM,"I see. My first impression was that you finished a whole pop in 7 mins, and I was like ??? Xd",
udishab#2211,21-Feb-18 11:44 PM,^^ that'd be pretty impressive,

angrymunch739#7866,22-Feb-18 08:40 PM,Ya,
angrymunch739#7866,22-Feb-18 08:40 PM,U serious?,
MooshRum#3936,22-Feb-18 08:40 PM,Everyone looks the same. Seniors take freshman classes. Freshman take junior classes,
angrymunch739#7866,22-Feb-18 08:40 PM,True,
MooshRum#3936,22-Feb-18 08:40 PM,Just don't be overly ambitious an talkative in classes tbh,

angrymunch739#7866,22-Feb-18 08:41 PM,Are there classes that are like highschool  wise like the chairs and desks @Snowfish#4289,
MooshRum#3936,22-Feb-18 08:41 PM,Like don't try to prove yourself to your professors in a giant lecture hall,
Snowfish#4289,22-Feb-18 08:41 PM,everyone super nice and helpful as a freshman then when ura sophomore ur irrelevant again,
angrymunch739#7866,22-Feb-18 08:41 PM,Like small classes,
Snowfish#4289,22-Feb-18 08:41 PM,yeah,
Snowfish#4289,22-Feb-18 08:41 PM,a few,
MooshRum#3936,22-Feb-18 08:41 PM,Yeah it depends on the major,
angrymunch739#7866,22-Feb-18 08:41 PM,What majors,
Snowfish#4289,22-Feb-18 08:41 PM,STEM majors not so much,
angrymunch739#7866,22-Feb-18 08:42 PM,Well like intro classes?,

MooshRum#3936,22-Feb-18 08:42 PM,Nah even upper level classes are still sort of distant,
Snowfish#4289,22-Feb-18 08:42 PM,its honestly entirely dependent on the major,
Snowfish#4289,22-Feb-18 08:42 PM,like CS classes get smaller the higher you go,
angrymunch739#7866,22-Feb-18 08:42 PM,So for computer engineering,
Snowfish#4289,22-Feb-18 08:42 PM,¯\_(ツ)_/¯,
Snowfish#4289,22-Feb-18 08:42 PM,no idea,
Snowfish#4289,22-Feb-18 08:42 PM,depends on the professor teaching too,
MooshRum#3936,22-Feb-18 08:42 PM,They will be highschool setups but the professors won't know your name and you won't know the other students names tbh,
angrymunch739#7866,22-Feb-18 08:43 PM,Ah do people try to meet each other like from lecture classes,
MooshRum#3936,22-Feb-18 08:43 PM,The biggest thing for me in college was how little you know other people in your classes,
MooshRum#3936,22-Feb-18 08:43 PM,Oh god no,
angrymunch739#7866,22-Feb-18 08:43 PM,Y,
angrymunch739#7866,22-Feb-18 08:43 PM,So you should sit by urself,
MooshRum#3936,22-Feb-18 08:44 PM,No but you can sit next to someone the entire yesr and never know their name,
MooshRum#3936,22-Feb-18 08:44 PM,Super common,
angrymunch739#7866,22-Feb-18 08:44 PM,Ah,
angrymunch739#7866,22-Feb-18 08:45 PM,Wouldn't it be more interesting to know people while attending class,
MooshRum#3936,22-Feb-18 08:45 PM,Not really. Most classes if they aren't group work you just go and listen to professor for an hour then leave to your next class,
angrymunch739#7866,22-Feb-18 08:45 PM,Ah,
MooshRum#3936,22-Feb-18 08:46 PM,It's not like highschool where if you are in this certain class you are the same year and similar schedule to other students in the class,
angrymunch739#7866,22-Feb-18 08:46 PM,Would you say AP classes is mainly same circculum in college classes,
angrymunch739#7866,22-Feb-18 08:46 PM,Like ap mirco,
MooshRum#3936,22-Feb-18 08:47 PM,It's about the same difficulty if not harder than some.,
angrymunch739#7866,22-Feb-18 08:47 PM,Ah okay thanks,
MooshRum#3936,22-Feb-18 08:48 PM,But then there are some college classes that are way harder,
angrymunch739#7866,22-Feb-18 08:48 PM,What is one thing you hate about tech disregarding rigor,
MooshRum#3936,22-Feb-18 08:48 PM,Or you have to deal with a harshly graded class,
MooshRum#3936,22-Feb-18 08:48 PM,Probably the grading or test load,
MooshRum#3936,22-Feb-18 08:48 PM,You will have What are known as Hell weeks,
angrymunch739#7866,22-Feb-18 08:48 PM,"Also I heard there's no curve, almost every one fails their test and its normal",

MEE6#4876,22-Feb-18 09:20 PM,"GG @__]%#6618, you just advanced to level 4!",
angrymunch739#7866,22-Feb-18 09:20 PM,Oh yeah is it true they check ur hw if u copied off the internet,
BradfordOfMars#9837,22-Feb-18 09:20 PM,yes,
angrymunch739#7866,22-Feb-18 09:20 PM,Like they run the hw through,
MooshRum#3936,22-Feb-18 09:20 PM,I have like no homework,
MooshRum#3936,22-Feb-18 09:21 PM,I just have weekly quizzes,
BradfordOfMars#9837,22-Feb-18 09:21 PM,depends on the class,
MooshRum#3936,22-Feb-18 09:21 PM,And then random assignments,
Rye#0666,22-Feb-18 09:21 PM,Yeah I don't get much in the distance math classes,
Rye#0666,22-Feb-18 09:21 PM,But seriously screw MyMathLab,
Rye#0666,22-Feb-18 09:21 PM,Worst website ever,
BradfordOfMars#9837,22-Feb-18 09:21 PM,online stuff does tend to be run through checkers,
BradfordOfMars#9837,22-Feb-18 09:21 PM,well youll probably get more of it,
angrymunch739#7866,22-Feb-18 09:21 PM,😩,
BradfordOfMars#9837,22-Feb-18 09:21 PM,I had very little hw last semester but I have a good bit this semester,
BradfordOfMars#9837,22-Feb-18 09:22 PM,lots of the lab sciences use it too,
Rye#0666,22-Feb-18 09:22 PM,MML?,
BradfordOfMars#9837,22-Feb-18 09:22 PM,"well, pearson",
BradfordOfMars#9837,22-Feb-18 09:22 PM,"same site, different class",
Rye#0666,22-Feb-18 09:22 PM,Gross,
BradfordOfMars#9837,22-Feb-18 09:22 PM,yep,
BradfordOfMars#9837,22-Feb-18 09:22 PM,although I heard physics moved away from it this semester to some new site,
8726andrew#5709,22-Feb-18 09:23 PM,im guessing its so prevalent bc tech probably gets $$$$ for using it,
BradfordOfMars#9837,22-Feb-18 09:23 PM,nah,
Lennox#3038,22-Feb-18 09:23 PM,mml is still way better than other ones i've used,
Lennox#3038,22-Feb-18 09:23 PM,like webassign,
BradfordOfMars#9837,22-Feb-18 09:24 PM,its just easy for the professors to get questions from a database that is associated with well known textbooks,
8726andrew#5709,22-Feb-18 09:24 PM,webassign is better for answer checking but worse for figuring out problems,
8726andrew#5709,22-Feb-18 09:24 PM,like this happened to me the other day,https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/402517390669381633/416420053030928394/fuck_pearson_1.PNG
BradfordOfMars#9837,22-Feb-18 09:25 PM,yeah the formatting is hell,
BradfordOfMars#9837,22-Feb-18 09:25 PM,every single answer can be formatted differently,
8726andrew#5709,22-Feb-18 09:25 PM,online hw is just death no matter what the program is tbh,
8726andrew#5709,22-Feb-18 09:26 PM,sometimes theres multiple answers and it only takes 1 of them as right,
Lennox#3038,22-Feb-18 09:28 PM,The only real problem I've had was when it wanted a specific non row-reduced echelon form of a matrix,
Lennox#3038,22-Feb-18 09:28 PM,despite there being like infinite possibilities,
8726andrew#5709,22-Feb-18 09:28 PM,i had another one where it wanted a google matrix and it decided it wanted 5 decimal places and didn't mention that any where so it counted my answers without all the 0s wrong,
BradfordOfMars#9837,22-Feb-18 09:29 PM,yeah I remember those days during distance math,
BradfordOfMars#9837,22-Feb-18 09:29 PM,we were all frustrated with it,
MooshRum#3936,22-Feb-18 09:29 PM,online hw is stupid,
MooshRum#3936,22-Feb-18 09:29 PM,But they normally let you have like 2 ateempts and its easy to get a 100,

8726andrew#5709,23-Feb-18 07:07 AM,The trick to not sleep through all your alarms is to change the intervals between them,
8726andrew#5709,23-Feb-18 07:08 AM,"Separate them with like 3,4,5,6 minutes or something and make all of them different",
thedragonlegacy#2854,23-Feb-18 07:40 AM,I do tho,
kk4jrq#5652,23-Feb-18 07:52 AM,Trust me I will still sleep through it,
Nobo#2748,23-Feb-18 10:59 AM,"I set three different alarms, one on watch, phone, and alarm clock, also with intervals",
8726andrew#5709,23-Feb-18 11:07 AM,I honestly only wake up bc my watch vibrates on my wrist,
8726andrew#5709,23-Feb-18 11:07 AM,Before I had it my alarm clock gets louder and louder if you don’t turn it off,
8726andrew#5709,23-Feb-18 11:08 AM,Sometimes it would snooze and not turn off so I’d be downstairs and all of a sudden hear it and have to sprint back to my room so I didn’t wake up the whole house,
Arya201#6452,23-Feb-18 11:12 AM,heyo,
Arya201#6452,23-Feb-18 11:13 AM,"great andrew, I might need a watch like that",
Arya201#6452,23-Feb-18 11:13 AM,can't never get enough sleep,
angrymunch739#7866,23-Feb-18 11:16 AM,What are some suggestions when registering for classes during freshman orientation?,
angrymunch739#7866,23-Feb-18 11:16 AM,@Snowfish#4289 @BradfordOfMars#9837,
8726andrew#5709,23-Feb-18 11:21 AM,Lol my watch is expensive af bc it’s a gps watch but a smart watch probably can too,
Snowfish#4289,23-Feb-18 11:22 AM,bring your own laptop,
BradfordOfMars#9837,23-Feb-18 11:23 AM,and plan your schedule ahead of time using courseoff with alternatives so you can have the codes ready to schedule the second your time opens,
Snowfish#4289,23-Feb-18 11:23 AM,yeah that too,
Snowfish#4289,23-Feb-18 11:24 AM,https://gatech.courseoff.com/workspace,
BradfordOfMars#9837,23-Feb-18 11:24 AM,They’ll tell you at FASET to not use courseoff because it’s unreliable but ignore them,
Snowfish#4289,23-Feb-18 11:26 AM,"yeah, honestly if you're really worried double-check with the actual course listing, but ive never, EVER had it be wrong",
Snowfish#4289,23-Feb-18 11:26 AM,its a good way to visualize your schedule if nothing else,
BradfordOfMars#9837,23-Feb-18 11:29 AM,"Also, don’t worry that much if you don’t get into the classes that you want because lots of space opens up during phase 2 registration the week before and during the first week of classes as people drop stuff. I had four alternative schedules going into FASET and only got half a schedule. I ended up getting everything that I wanted by just being waitlisted, even though it was hella stressful",
angrymunch739#7866,23-Feb-18 12:15 PM,Ok and how would I research what professors for the classes? I get to choose what professors too correct? Thanks for the help!,
Snowfish#4289,23-Feb-18 12:18 PM,yeah you get the name of the professor when you look at the sections,
Snowfish#4289,23-Feb-18 12:18 PM,you can look them up on course critique and ratemyprofessor but sometimes you’re just out of luck and you gotta hope,
angrymunch739#7866,23-Feb-18 12:19 PM,"Also I know there's a requirement for an amount of credits that is supposed to be completed b4 graduation, would you recommend like splitting certain amount of hours into 4 years like x amount of hours per year?",
Nobo#2748,23-Feb-18 12:50 PM,"While some people may block out their entire time at Tech into perfect segment each semester, there's a lot of variation that inevitably happens - you might not get to fit in every class each semester, or something might happen to otherwise set you back., Likewise, don't bite more than you can get in your first semester or two - get adjusted to the courseload first.",
Nobo#2748,23-Feb-18 12:52 PM,"For the typical GT student, taking 14-17 hours each semester is enough to get you settled in - don't worry about getting specific hours in, worry about getting your prerequisite classes in so you can take upper-level courses later",
kk4jrq#5652,23-Feb-18 12:55 PM,What is the worst of the core classes?  like the ones to weed you out...,
Arya201#6452,23-Feb-18 12:56 PM,"honestly, I don't think theres any worst class",
Arya201#6452,23-Feb-18 12:57 PM,"We all have different preferences,",
Arya201#6452,23-Feb-18 12:57 PM,some students might find a class fun that bores me or some other student,
Arya201#6452,23-Feb-18 12:57 PM,"But then again, it greatly depends on the professors too",
kk4jrq#5652,23-Feb-18 12:59 PM,True...,
kk4jrq#5652,23-Feb-18 12:59 PM,Got that professor that doesn't believe in A's...,
Arya201#6452,23-Feb-18 01:00 PM,yeah,
Arya201#6452,23-Feb-18 01:00 PM,"Well I got weird teachers at school here,",
Arya201#6452,23-Feb-18 01:00 PM,half of them are oblivious of the content,
Arya201#6452,23-Feb-18 01:00 PM,they don't know what they are actually teaching,
Arya201#6452,23-Feb-18 01:00 PM,and end up talking about their personal lives,
kk4jrq#5652,23-Feb-18 01:00 PM,I'm sitting in econ now and our class literally can't understand MR = MC...,
kk4jrq#5652,23-Feb-18 01:00 PM,It's so bad,
Arya201#6452,23-Feb-18 01:01 PM,"Honestly, I never liked Eco so I never picked it up",
Arya201#6452,23-Feb-18 01:01 PM,"so when subject selection take, I moved far far away from eco",
kk4jrq#5652,23-Feb-18 01:03 PM,I love econ,
kk4jrq#5652,23-Feb-18 01:03 PM,It's so much fun,
kk4jrq#5652,23-Feb-18 01:03 PM,But that class makes it so dumb,
Arya201#6452,23-Feb-18 01:03 PM,We had Econ clashing with CS,
Arya201#6452,23-Feb-18 01:03 PM,so...,
Arya201#6452,23-Feb-18 01:04 PM,"I actually love Computer Science, I went for that instead",
Arya201#6452,23-Feb-18 01:04 PM,and Econ goes straight over my head,
kk4jrq#5652,23-Feb-18 01:11 PM,CS is better than econ for sure...,
Arya201#6452,23-Feb-18 01:13 PM,CS is lifetime favourite,
Arya201#6452,23-Feb-18 01:13 PM,although...,
Arya201#6452,23-Feb-18 01:13 PM,I did not decide to major in CS,

angrymunch739#7866,23-Feb-18 01:28 PM,Aye!,

8726andrew#5709,23-Feb-18 10:42 PM,the perfect temperature range is 50-70,

8726andrew#5709,25-Feb-18 05:09 PM,I eat it a lot bc the other options are not good either,
Snowfish#4289,25-Feb-18 05:09 PM,don't objectify an object,
Snowfish#4289,25-Feb-18 05:09 PM,🤔,
pulpfucker#3293,25-Feb-18 05:09 PM,Lol,
pulpfucker#3293,25-Feb-18 05:09 PM,Hats where we differ,

Rye#0666,25-Feb-18 05:16 PM,I'm a pizza snob,
Rye#0666,25-Feb-18 05:16 PM,No chains,
Rye#0666,25-Feb-18 05:17 PM,Only local places,
Rye#0666,25-Feb-18 05:17 PM,I was raised by New Yorkers so that's where I got it from,
Rye#0666,25-Feb-18 05:17 PM,Well my dad grew up around Buffalo but he went to NYU for his last degree,
pulpfucker#3293,25-Feb-18 05:24 PM,@Rye#0666 noice brah,
cMikeHaynes#3158,25-Feb-18 06:15 PM,Yeah it's expensive asf but worth it every once in a while,
Lennox#3038,25-Feb-18 06:54 PM,but the real question is,
Lennox#3038,25-Feb-18 06:54 PM,What's the consensus of pineapple as a topping?,
arechawla#3188,25-Feb-18 06:55 PM,I don't really like pineapple on pizza,
thedragonlegacy#2854,25-Feb-18 06:56 PM,I like pineapple as a topping. but it has to go with ham.,
sophie#9067,25-Feb-18 07:00 PM,^^,
Lennox#3038,25-Feb-18 07:01 PM,That's fair,
thedragonlegacy#2854,25-Feb-18 07:01 PM,"""but""",
Lennox#3038,25-Feb-18 07:02 PM,caught me,
Lennox#3038,25-Feb-18 07:02 PM,...but I think too much meat starts to detract from the core pizza experience,
Lennox#3038,25-Feb-18 07:02 PM,i could rock pineapple on its lonesome,
thedragonlegacy#2854,25-Feb-18 07:04 PM,well,
thedragonlegacy#2854,25-Feb-18 07:04 PM,then it kinda becomes a desert,
Lennox#3038,25-Feb-18 07:04 PM,(never a problem),
MEE6#4876,25-Feb-18 07:04 PM,"GG @Lennox#3038, you just advanced to level 9!",
thedragonlegacy#2854,25-Feb-18 07:04 PM,with nothing to balance the pineapple out,
thedragonlegacy#2854,25-Feb-18 07:04 PM,LOL,
thedragonlegacy#2854,25-Feb-18 07:04 PM,u not wrong,
thedragonlegacy#2854,25-Feb-18 07:05 PM,though i think that different sauces besides tomato should be offered,
Lennox#3038,25-Feb-18 07:06 PM,Definitely,
Lennox#3038,25-Feb-18 07:07 PM,I've been to one of those build your own pizza places where I could choose a garlic rub instead of tomato sauce,
Lennox#3038,25-Feb-18 07:07 PM,would highly recommend,
Lennox#3038,25-Feb-18 07:07 PM,although you do begin blurring the line between pizza and cheese bread w/ toppings,
8726andrew#5709,25-Feb-18 07:09 PM,pineapple on pizza is a disgrace,
8726andrew#5709,25-Feb-18 07:09 PM,its a waste of pizza,
thedragonlegacy#2854,25-Feb-18 07:10 PM,there's a pizza place at MoG that offers different sauces. i tried alfredo sauce on mi pizza and it was really scrumptious lmao,
thedragonlegacy#2854,25-Feb-18 07:10 PM,oooo garlic rub sounds good,
thedragonlegacy#2854,25-Feb-18 07:11 PM,we can't be friends anymore @8726andrew#5709,
thedragonlegacy#2854,25-Feb-18 07:11 PM,xP,
8726andrew#5709,25-Feb-18 07:11 PM,lmao tbh i dont actually care,
8726andrew#5709,25-Feb-18 07:12 PM,i dont like pineapple to begin with so putting it on pizza doesnt change my opinion of it,
8726andrew#5709,25-Feb-18 07:12 PM,i just hate on it partially for the memes,
8726andrew#5709,25-Feb-18 07:12 PM,one thing im not a fan of is pizza without pizza sauce,
8726andrew#5709,25-Feb-18 07:12 PM,like its okay its just a lot different,
Lennox#3038,25-Feb-18 07:13 PM,I might be biased because I'm not a big sauce person in general,
Lennox#3038,25-Feb-18 07:13 PM,but I think it sort of dilutes the pizza,
8726andrew#5709,25-Feb-18 07:13 PM,if theres too much yeah,
8726andrew#5709,25-Feb-18 07:14 PM,but usually places dont put too much,
8726andrew#5709,25-Feb-18 07:14 PM,school pizza tho 🤢,
thedragonlegacy#2854,25-Feb-18 07:18 PM,garlic breadsticks are bomb,
Lennox#3038,25-Feb-18 07:20 PM,"garlic breadsticks, knots, and rolls are the holy trinity of appetizers",
thedragonlegacy#2854,25-Feb-18 07:26 PM,lmao why not make it a meal while you're at it,
8726andrew#5709,25-Feb-18 07:26 PM,im that guy who when you go to thanksgiving i eat the entirety of the basket of rolls by myself,
8726andrew#5709,25-Feb-18 07:27 PM,"now they jokingly make a couple pans and say ""this one is all for you!"" and then i actually eat the whole thing",
8726andrew#5709,25-Feb-18 07:27 PM,so garlic bread is love,
8726andrew#5709,25-Feb-18 07:27 PM,garlic bread is life,
thedragonlegacy#2854,25-Feb-18 07:28 PM,❤,
thedragonlegacy#2854,25-Feb-18 07:28 PM,no wonder you have a pretzel addiction,
thedragonlegacy#2854,25-Feb-18 07:28 PM,which came first-- your garlic bread love or pretzel love?,
8726andrew#5709,25-Feb-18 07:28 PM,yes,
8726andrew#5709,25-Feb-18 07:28 PM,probably pretzels,
thedragonlegacy#2854,25-Feb-18 07:34 PM,honestly why are pretzels SO GOOD,

thedragonlegacy#2854,25-Feb-18 09:20 PM,yo have you guys heard of a carrington event,
kk4jrq#5652,25-Feb-18 09:26 PM,No wat dayt,
thedragonlegacy#2854,25-Feb-18 09:27 PM,it's a mega solar flare,
thedragonlegacy#2854,25-Feb-18 09:28 PM,"""carrington solar flare""",
thedragonlegacy#2854,25-Feb-18 09:29 PM,"however, the first notable occurrence of the mega flare happened in 1859",
thedragonlegacy#2854,25-Feb-18 09:29 PM,basically it really screwed with Earth's magnetic geosphere,
kk4jrq#5652,25-Feb-18 09:29 PM,How many have happened since?,
thedragonlegacy#2854,25-Feb-18 09:30 PM,and generated electric energy that caused an outage to the US technology back then,
thedragonlegacy#2854,25-Feb-18 09:31 PM,their telegraph technology basically died,
thedragonlegacy#2854,25-Feb-18 09:31 PM,some telegraph workers were reportedly injured/dead due to the electric shocks,
thedragonlegacy#2854,25-Feb-18 09:32 PM,"I don't think any have happened since then, at least, at the level of the Carrington Event",
thedragonlegacy#2854,25-Feb-18 09:33 PM,"Since we're so dependent on technology, it makes you think how decapitated we'd be if another happened soon",
thedragonlegacy#2854,25-Feb-18 09:35 PM,"```""The latest example was in 2005, when X-rays from a solar flare disrupted satellite-to-ground communication and the GPS system for about 10 minutes — threatening satellite-guided air, sea, and land travel.""```",

udishab#2211,28-Feb-18 09:38 PM,lol it took them so much longer to review early action apps vs normal decision apps,
8726andrew#5709,28-Feb-18 09:38 PM,smh admissions probbaly just got lazy,
8726andrew#5709,28-Feb-18 09:39 PM,we all procrastinate everything so they probably do too,

8726andrew#5709,01-Mar-18 05:01 PM,Financial aid comes out at the earliest April 1st iirc,
8726andrew#5709,01-Mar-18 05:01 PM,That’s if you were in time for the priority deadline,
angrymunch739#7866,01-Mar-18 06:32 PM,Usually how many students are admitted through RD? For tech,
Rye#0666,01-Mar-18 06:39 PM,I think about the same as EA?,
angrymunch739#7866,01-Mar-18 07:48 PM,So what if like all 8k students join hypothetically,
Lennox#3038,01-Mar-18 08:39 PM,you're gonna need a bigger boat,
thedragonlegacy#2854,01-Mar-18 08:42 PM,why? we’ll be sinking in despair anyways,

8726andrew#5709,01-Mar-18 09:35 PM,i mean out of like what 4k or whatever we have 200ish?,
8726andrew#5709,01-Mar-18 09:35 PM,at most id say it'd be like 500,
udishab#2211,01-Mar-18 09:48 PM,i thought like more people get in EA,

waffle.dynasty#2740,02-Mar-18 07:52 PM,Last year the entire senior class (~800 people) tried to fit themselves in a classroom and hold a rave during a passing period. The police at my school had to break it all up. I had class in that room that period. It smelled soooo bad,
thedragonlegacy#2854,02-Mar-18 07:54 PM,uh... why not the gym? or cafeteria?,
thedragonlegacy#2854,02-Mar-18 07:55 PM,and RIP,
waffle.dynasty#2740,02-Mar-18 07:55 PM,Im not sure. The teacher whose room was used is very young and I think was part of the planning (although she denies it) so maybe that's why,
thedragonlegacy#2854,02-Mar-18 07:56 PM,e_____E did they even fit?,
waffle.dynasty#2740,02-Mar-18 07:58 PM,"A lot of them did actually but it did spread out into the hallway. I was stuck outside obviously so I saw what went on outside, but I hear that the room itself was really lit like a real rave whatever that means. I saw one guy dance shirtless on a table outside before one of the police officers yelled at him",

8726andrew#5709,06-Mar-18 09:33 PM,it takes ~4 if you have to cross campus entirely,
8726andrew#5709,06-Mar-18 09:33 PM,walking fast,
thedragonlegacy#2854,06-Mar-18 09:34 PM,some teachers are like,
thedragonlegacy#2854,06-Mar-18 09:34 PM,"""why didn't you use the bathroom during the class break""",
thedragonlegacy#2854,06-Mar-18 09:34 PM,:seriously:,
Snowfish#4289,06-Mar-18 09:34 PM,holy shit,
Snowfish#4289,06-Mar-18 09:34 PM,stop it you're going to trigger me,
Snowfish#4289,06-Mar-18 09:34 PM,the best shit about college is you can just walk in like 30 minutes late and no one gives a fuck,
thedragonlegacy#2854,06-Mar-18 09:35 PM,can't wait,
thedragonlegacy#2854,06-Mar-18 09:35 PM,you're increasing my senioritis symptoms,
Snowfish#4289,06-Mar-18 09:36 PM,i had the worst senioritis,
Snowfish#4289,06-Mar-18 09:36 PM,i feel bad for my teachers,
8726andrew#5709,06-Mar-18 09:36 PM,One time during math a kid walked in with like 5 minutes left in class and Lubinsky roasted him hard it was hilarious,

Snowfish#4289,06-Mar-18 09:57 PM,?info,
Snowfish#4289,06-Mar-18 09:57 PM,not working here either,
Gadget246#0848,07-Mar-18 08:41 AM,@supremeavenger#3061 it used to be a tradition at my school for seniors to post them even though lots of people don't use their lockers,
Gadget246#0848,07-Mar-18 08:42 AM,I'm pretty sure I gave myself back damage by marching tenor drums not by carrying too heavy a backpack 😂,
Gadget246#0848,07-Mar-18 08:43 AM,tbh i think the teachers at my school have senioritis more than the students do,
Gadget246#0848,07-Mar-18 08:44 AM,we've missed so many school days and have had so many silly procedures handed down from administration that this whole semester has turned into a joke,
kk4jrq#5652,07-Mar-18 08:44 AM,When you should be studying but you just chilling in #general,
Gadget246#0848,07-Mar-18 08:45 AM,my school doesn't have water today so they told me to go home,
kk4jrq#5652,07-Mar-18 09:28 AM,Wtf...,
kk4jrq#5652,07-Mar-18 09:28 AM,Why don't they have water @Gadget246#0848,
Gadget246#0848,07-Mar-18 10:00 AM,a water main broke,
Gadget246#0848,07-Mar-18 10:01 AM,"i have water but I have to boil it before I use it for anything, lots of people have water but only low pressure",
kk4jrq#5652,07-Mar-18 10:15 AM,Yikes...,
Gadget246#0848,07-Mar-18 01:22 PM,"yeah, but I get a free day out of it so i'm fine with it lol",

waffle.dynasty#2740,07-Mar-18 05:40 PM,Gotcha,

kk4jrq#5652,07-Mar-18 05:42 PM,Except of course... Gracious Professionalism,
waffle.dynasty#2740,07-Mar-18 05:42 PM,Yummy,
waffle.dynasty#2740,07-Mar-18 05:42 PM,I sure do loooove gracious professionalism,
Snowfish#4289,07-Mar-18 05:43 PM,robotics looks like so much fun,
kk4jrq#5652,07-Mar-18 05:44 PM,So do y'all have those teams that you know the mentors built the whole robot? @waffle.dynasty#2740 cuz we sure do...,
waffle.dynasty#2740,07-Mar-18 05:45 PM,I don't actually know lol pretty much every team in Indiana is mediocre. Us included,
kk4jrq#5652,07-Mar-18 05:46 PM,Is that serious or sarcastic @Snowfish#4289,
Snowfish#4289,07-Mar-18 05:46 PM,no im serious,
waffle.dynasty#2740,07-Mar-18 05:46 PM,Seems like mentors don't want to touch the bot,
Snowfish#4289,07-Mar-18 05:46 PM,it looks like fun,
kk4jrq#5652,07-Mar-18 05:46 PM,They call it the hardest fun you'll ever have...,
kk4jrq#5652,07-Mar-18 05:46 PM,They are very right,
kk4jrq#5652,07-Mar-18 05:47 PM,Our teams mentors won't touch our bot but we have a few teams in Georgia whose students have never touched the robot,
waffle.dynasty#2740,07-Mar-18 05:47 PM,Nice,
kk4jrq#5652,07-Mar-18 05:47 PM,Yep,
waffle.dynasty#2740,07-Mar-18 05:47 PM,Good learning experience for those kids,
kk4jrq#5652,07-Mar-18 05:47 PM,For sure... You should see them try to present to judges.  It's actually hilarious,
Snowfish#4289,07-Mar-18 05:47 PM,i remember it being a huge thing at my school but i lived too far away to ever participate,
Snowfish#4289,07-Mar-18 05:47 PM,:FeelsBadMan:,
kk4jrq#5652,07-Mar-18 05:48 PM,:PepeHands: that's terrible,
Snowfish#4289,07-Mar-18 05:48 PM,yeah,
Snowfish#4289,07-Mar-18 05:48 PM,attendance was way too strict,
Snowfish#4289,07-Mar-18 05:48 PM,was like 3/5 days a week,
Snowfish#4289,07-Mar-18 05:48 PM,and i couldnt make that shit with a 40 min drive there/back,
kk4jrq#5652,07-Mar-18 05:48 PM,True...,
kk4jrq#5652,07-Mar-18 05:48 PM,I mean you could but then you'd probably start doing really bad in classes,
kk4jrq#5652,07-Mar-18 05:49 PM,Hey you could always join like Robojackets now... I'm hoping to join.,
Snowfish#4289,07-Mar-18 05:49 PM,im already locked into being the esports _forcefully appointed_ president so rip time for other extracurriculars,
kk4jrq#5652,07-Mar-18 05:50 PM,Rip,
kk4jrq#5652,07-Mar-18 05:51 PM,So what do y'all do with Esports? I'm just curious cuz I'm interested in that too...  Would it be viable to do robot jackets and that?,
Snowfish#4289,07-Mar-18 05:52 PM,"being a member isnt too hard to combine with other ec's, since most of the league games are either super ""late"" (like 9PM) at night or over the weekend, so it really shouldnt conflict, and we aren't strict on attendance at our weekly meetings at all",
Snowfish#4289,07-Mar-18 05:53 PM,"we compete in collegiate leagues for lots of games, ie hearthstone, dota 2, csgo, overwatch, etc",
Snowfish#4289,07-Mar-18 05:53 PM,"and its not for nothing, we actually do get a win a good bit of money lol",
kk4jrq#5652,07-Mar-18 05:53 PM,Sweet... I'll definitely be joining lol,
Snowfish#4289,07-Mar-18 05:54 PM,yeah i mean even if you dont compete we support casual players,
Snowfish#4289,07-Mar-18 05:54 PM,like the csgo guys host gigantic 10v10 inhouses like multiple times a week,
kk4jrq#5652,07-Mar-18 05:55 PM,Sweet!  I'd probably want to at least try to compete.  If I'm good enough that is....,
kk4jrq#5652,07-Mar-18 05:55 PM,I'm trying to improve at all my Esports titles rn before college... I barely have had time to play the last few months and it's showing,
Snowfish#4289,07-Mar-18 05:55 PM,"even if you're not ""good enough"", most games have a lower division that's more casual, cheaper, and has a smaller prize pool",
kk4jrq#5652,07-Mar-18 05:56 PM,Sweet.  Thanks for all the info dude,
Snowfish#4289,07-Mar-18 05:56 PM,"np, it helps me to give info cuz then we get more members",
kk4jrq#5652,07-Mar-18 05:56 PM,Well you can go ahead and count me in for next semester!,
Snowfish#4289,07-Mar-18 05:56 PM,eyyy cool,
Snowfish#4289,07-Mar-18 05:57 PM,"if you're seriously interested/you know anyone interested, follow/like/whatever you do on facebook this page: https://www.facebook.com/GeorgiaTechEsports/",
Snowfish#4289,07-Mar-18 05:57 PM,cuz that's where we'll put the meeting announcements for next semester,
kk4jrq#5652,07-Mar-18 05:58 PM,Sweet. Just followed it and set up notifications so I'll be in the loop!,
Snowfish#4289,07-Mar-18 05:59 PM,yess i have gained one,
kk4jrq#5652,07-Mar-18 05:59 PM,Btw those jerseys look dope af,
Snowfish#4289,07-Mar-18 05:59 PM,the guy handling the jerseys still hasnt given mine to me so I WOULDNT KNOW,
kk4jrq#5652,07-Mar-18 05:59 PM,:rip:,
kk4jrq#5652,07-Mar-18 06:00 PM,If the president doesn't have one...,
Snowfish#4289,07-Mar-18 06:01 PM,we just have sitcom-levels of bad timing,
Snowfish#4289,07-Mar-18 06:01 PM,"like the times he was handing them out last semester was when i had exams, and every time he's tried to do it this semester, something has come up for me",
Snowfish#4289,07-Mar-18 06:01 PM,~~or i forgot~~,
kk4jrq#5652,07-Mar-18 06:02 PM,Hey keeps it interesting... If it all went smoothly it'd be boring,
Snowfish#4289,07-Mar-18 06:02 PM,hell no i cant agree with that statement,
Snowfish#4289,07-Mar-18 06:02 PM,its not interesting or fun when our pizzas get delayed by 30 minutes and i come back to find a literal coup forming in my absence,
kk4jrq#5652,07-Mar-18 06:03 PM,Well then...,

Arya201#6452,07-Mar-18 11:43 PM,Omg I feel so happy :'),
Arya201#6452,07-Mar-18 11:43 PM,Yeah exactly sleep is for the week,
Arya201#6452,07-Mar-18 11:43 PM,None of us should sleep,
Arya201#6452,07-Mar-18 11:44 PM,We should all spend 24/7 socializing,
Chafos#1781,07-Mar-18 11:44 PM,studies show that humans actually evolved to get less sleep than normal to spend more time socializing,
Arya201#6452,07-Mar-18 11:44 PM,True that,
Arya201#6452,07-Mar-18 11:45 PM,Everyone should actually stop sleeping,
Arya201#6452,07-Mar-18 11:45 PM,Because sleep is overrated,
Chafos#1781,07-Mar-18 11:46 PM,if sleep wasn't needed I definitely wouldn't ever sleep,
Chafos#1781,07-Mar-18 11:46 PM,many more exciting things to be doing,
Arya201#6452,07-Mar-18 11:46 PM,I can relate. I only sleep because it's like a necessity for survival.,
Arya201#6452,07-Mar-18 11:47 PM,After midnight is the real day,
Chafos#1781,07-Mar-18 11:47 PM,true,

Arya201#6452,07-Mar-18 11:48 PM,Lolol,
Arya201#6452,07-Mar-18 11:48 PM,My parents have this odd idea that you remember stuff if you study very very early in the morning.,

Chafos#1781,07-Mar-18 11:49 PM,yeah same,
Arya201#6452,07-Mar-18 11:49 PM,However I actually think 2am is a good time to study,
Arya201#6452,07-Mar-18 11:49 PM,Not 5am eww,

Arya201#6452,07-Mar-18 11:50 PM,Yeah sameeee,
Arya201#6452,07-Mar-18 11:50 PM,5am is the watching sunrise time,
Arya201#6452,07-Mar-18 11:50 PM,It's not study Time? Not at all,
Arya201#6452,07-Mar-18 11:50 PM,Also my high school does not have lockers 😩 😩,
Chafos#1781,07-Mar-18 11:51 PM,I have 5 minutes between classes so I don't even use my locker,
Arya201#6452,07-Mar-18 11:51 PM,I actually wanted to know how it feels to have a locker at least,
Chafos#1781,07-Mar-18 11:52 PM,that's fair,
Arya201#6452,07-Mar-18 11:52 PM,We have to carry 20kg bags to school because NO locker.,
Arya201#6452,07-Mar-18 11:52 PM,And it can get heavy,
Chafos#1781,07-Mar-18 11:52 PM,dang my backpack is heavy but not 20kg heavy,
Chafos#1781,07-Mar-18 11:52 PM,probably like 8-15 kg,
Arya201#6452,07-Mar-18 11:52 PM,We carried heavier bags in grade 2-6,
Arya201#6452,07-Mar-18 11:53 PM,"They torture was,",
Arya201#6452,07-Mar-18 11:53 PM,Will never keep extra books or something at school. Want us to bring our own books. And won't settle in without original books.,
Arya201#6452,07-Mar-18 11:53 PM,And original books are very heavy down here.,
Chafos#1781,07-Mar-18 11:54 PM,yeesh that sounds rough,
Chafos#1781,07-Mar-18 11:55 PM,hopefully more schools are going to start doing e-books so later generations won't have to go through this,
Arya201#6452,07-Mar-18 11:56 PM,True. Also my country is developing. So there's just one schools allowing e-books.,
Arya201#6452,07-Mar-18 11:56 PM,Hope someday soon my school stops being a weirdo,
Rye#0666,08-Mar-18 07:05 AM,@Arya201#6452 Have you attended school since January again?,
Arya201#6452,08-Mar-18 08:42 AM,yeah,
Arya201#6452,08-Mar-18 08:42 AM,because finals,
Arya201#6452,08-Mar-18 08:43 AM,Not allowed to miss school in March and April,
kk4jrq#5652,08-Mar-18 09:51 AM,If we are late to school 3 days.. we can't exempt finals...,
kk4jrq#5652,08-Mar-18 09:51 AM,It's so bad,
thedragonlegacy#2854,08-Mar-18 11:20 AM,:0 well shoot,
Arya201#6452,08-Mar-18 11:41 AM,That's pretty sad,
Arya201#6452,08-Mar-18 11:41 AM,"I think my school stays more or less empty, 12th graders rarely show up",
kk4jrq#5652,08-Mar-18 11:41 AM,Wow,
kk4jrq#5652,08-Mar-18 11:42 AM,I'm jealous,
Arya201#6452,08-Mar-18 11:42 AM,"Well Look, high school is a special time",
Arya201#6452,08-Mar-18 11:42 AM,Wasting it at home is not worth it,
Arya201#6452,08-Mar-18 11:42 AM,But our teachers are pretty sad.,
Arya201#6452,08-Mar-18 11:43 AM,They basically teach nothing at school and want you to go take private tuitions from them.,
Arya201#6452,08-Mar-18 11:43 AM,Which is basically more money in their pockets.,
Rye#0666,08-Mar-18 03:01 PM,Yikes,
Rye#0666,08-Mar-18 03:01 PM,Go to class,
Arya201#6452,08-Mar-18 03:02 PM,It's 2am 🙃,

kk4jrq#5652,09-Mar-18 09:46 PM,The great flood,

Arya201#6452,10-Mar-18 12:44 PM,I'm waiting to hear from one of my school seniors and a cousin,
Arya201#6452,10-Mar-18 12:44 PM,both applied,
udishab#2211,10-Mar-18 12:45 PM,there was only a 22% regular decision acceptance dang,
Arya201#6452,10-Mar-18 12:46 PM,ho much was the EA percentage?,
Rye#0666,10-Mar-18 12:46 PM,Around the same,
udishab#2211,10-Mar-18 12:47 PM,25% yeah,
Arya201#6452,10-Mar-18 12:47 PM,anyone here took chances with MIT?,
Lennox#3038,10-Mar-18 12:47 PM,I did,
Lennox#3038,10-Mar-18 12:47 PM,Not loving my chances,
udishab#2211,10-Mar-18 12:48 PM,lol i didnt apply,
Arya201#6452,10-Mar-18 12:48 PM,"i did too, and i'm not in love with my chances either tbh",
jakchoy#8192,10-Mar-18 12:48 PM,tbh i wish i applied to some more reach schools,
Lennox#3038,10-Mar-18 12:48 PM,"I only applied to tech, uga, and mit",
Arya201#6452,10-Mar-18 12:49 PM,so basically I guessed I wouldn't be accepted to most unis,
jakchoy#8192,10-Mar-18 12:49 PM,damn thats ballsy,
Arya201#6452,10-Mar-18 12:49 PM,so I ended up applying to too many safe universities and 6 nicely ranked ones,
jakchoy#8192,10-Mar-18 12:49 PM,same haha,
jakchoy#8192,10-Mar-18 12:49 PM,after getting into uw and uc davis im wondering if i underestimated myself,
Arya201#6452,10-Mar-18 12:49 PM,but looks like I turned out quite lucky for a change this time lol,
Lordbobby104#0879,10-Mar-18 12:50 PM,Lol I applied to two schools,
kk4jrq#5652,10-Mar-18 12:50 PM,That's the tough part about holistic... You don't know why you didn't get in even if your stats are up to par.,
Arya201#6452,10-Mar-18 12:50 PM,yoo i got uc davis too!,
Arya201#6452,10-Mar-18 12:50 PM,applied to some unis without reseach,
Arya201#6452,10-Mar-18 12:51 PM,like.. Minnesota twin cities,
Arya201#6452,10-Mar-18 12:51 PM,and Rice,
kk4jrq#5652,10-Mar-18 12:51 PM,I applied to like 5 schools... I only cared about Tech tho,
jakchoy#8192,10-Mar-18 12:51 PM,ye i applied to rice,
Arya201#6452,10-Mar-18 12:51 PM,"i care about tech, MIT and Upenn",
Lordbobby104#0879,10-Mar-18 12:51 PM,I only applied to tech and upenn,
jakchoy#8192,10-Mar-18 12:52 PM,my school got blacklisted from upenn lmao,
Cole#0059,10-Mar-18 12:52 PM,"I applied to 7 different places, and I've heard back from 4... this was my first acceptance, so I can finally calm down 😂",
jakchoy#8192,10-Mar-18 12:52 PM,"15 ppl applied, no one got in",
Arya201#6452,10-Mar-18 12:52 PM,😮,
Arya201#6452,10-Mar-18 12:52 PM,wow why?,
jakchoy#8192,10-Mar-18 12:52 PM,some girl got into mit ea and upenn ed,
jakchoy#8192,10-Mar-18 12:52 PM,she cancelled her ed and they found out so rip :/,
Arya201#6452,10-Mar-18 12:53 PM,ouch,
Arya201#6452,10-Mar-18 12:54 PM,thats not nice,
jakchoy#8192,10-Mar-18 12:54 PM,"yup, rip to all buisiness majors at my school",
udishab#2211,10-Mar-18 12:54 PM,that kinda sucks for all the other ppl in your school that applied upenn,
udishab#2211,10-Mar-18 12:55 PM,that girl shouldnt have applied ed to upenn anyway lol,
Arya201#6452,10-Mar-18 12:55 PM,tbh thats insensitive of Upenn to blacklist a whole school for one girll,
jakchoy#8192,10-Mar-18 12:55 PM,i heard its pretty serious to cancel ed though,
jakchoy#8192,10-Mar-18 12:55 PM,she was told that she would have to pay 4 year worth of tuition,
Arya201#6452,10-Mar-18 12:55 PM,yeah but thats something the girl gets to deal with,
jakchoy#8192,10-Mar-18 12:56 PM,"it happened a few years ago so idk what happened, theres rumors she somehow went to duke",
Cole#0059,10-Mar-18 12:56 PM,"I'm kinda surprised though... most of the time, both schools will take the acceptance away for something like that",
MEE6#4876,10-Mar-18 12:56 PM,"GG @Cole#0059, you just advanced to level 1!",
jakchoy#8192,10-Mar-18 12:56 PM,yup mit rescinded their admissions as well,
jakchoy#8192,10-Mar-18 12:56 PM,@Cole#0059,
Arya201#6452,10-Mar-18 12:56 PM,"sucks,",
Cole#0059,10-Mar-18 12:56 PM,i see,
Arya201#6452,10-Mar-18 12:56 PM,she shouldn't have underestimated her worth,
Arya201#6452,10-Mar-18 12:57 PM,she sounds like some real good student if she made into both,
jakchoy#8192,10-Mar-18 12:57 PM,tbh tho mit should be an ed school not an ea school,
jakchoy#8192,10-Mar-18 12:57 PM,"ye i heard she was, i mean she got into duke during rd so :/",
Arya201#6452,10-Mar-18 12:57 PM,I simply dont undertand the concept of binding a student,
jakchoy#8192,10-Mar-18 12:57 PM,its just how much you're willing to commit,
Arya201#6452,10-Mar-18 12:57 PM,"like if I cant pay you, do I sell my kidneys or what?",
jakchoy#8192,10-Mar-18 12:58 PM,oh theres actually a fine print,
jakchoy#8192,10-Mar-18 12:58 PM,"if you can't afford tuition, you can actually pull out the ed app without any punishment",
Cole#0059,10-Mar-18 12:58 PM,^^,
jakchoy#8192,10-Mar-18 12:58 PM,for most schools at least,
Chafos#1781,10-Mar-18 01:00 PM,I also applied to MIT.  Can’t wait to open my laptop to that glorious rejection letter on Wednesday 👌,
Cole#0059,10-Mar-18 01:00 PM,when does MIT come out?,
Chafos#1781,10-Mar-18 01:00 PM,Wednesday,
Chafos#1781,10-Mar-18 01:00 PM,Pi day at tau time,
jakchoy#8192,10-Mar-18 01:00 PM,oof,
Cole#0059,10-Mar-18 01:00 PM,oh rip,
jakchoy#8192,10-Mar-18 01:00 PM,good luck,
Lennox#3038,10-Mar-18 01:00 PM,They've already deferred me,
Lennox#3038,10-Mar-18 01:01 PM,so I think my chances are a 1.7%?,
Lennox#3038,10-Mar-18 01:01 PM,ez,
Chafos#1781,10-Mar-18 01:01 PM,yeah Princeton deferred me so I’m in a similar boat with them,
Arya201#6452,10-Mar-18 01:01 PM,pi day tau time is making me cringe,
Gadget246#0848,10-Mar-18 01:01 PM,"the fine print lets you pull out if you can't afford tuition, but their definition of afford is different than most people's",
Chafos#1781,10-Mar-18 01:01 PM,sorry,
Arya201#6452,10-Mar-18 01:01 PM,"might sound dumb, but I dont understand the deffered thing",
Arya201#6452,10-Mar-18 01:01 PM,could someone explain?,
Gadget246#0848,10-Mar-18 01:02 PM,they might still require you to go deep into debt,
Lennox#3038,10-Mar-18 01:02 PM,"When you apply early, they pick the very best ones and give them acceptance",
Chafos#1781,10-Mar-18 01:02 PM,"They reconsider you for regular decision, but you weren’t bad enough to get flat out rejected",
Lennox#3038,10-Mar-18 01:02 PM,then tell a bunch of others to wait until regular admission,
Arya201#6452,10-Mar-18 01:02 PM,ED?,
Chafos#1781,10-Mar-18 01:03 PM,I think it can be for either early action or early decision,
Arya201#6452,10-Mar-18 01:03 PM,nevermind ignore me I'm dumb,

Arya201#6452,10-Mar-18 01:16 PM,welcome to tech! You came to the best place,

Arya201#6452,10-Mar-18 01:22 PM,well I have no intentions to stick with Civil E,
Arya201#6452,10-Mar-18 01:22 PM,I have no idea how I ended up selecting it,
Arya201#6452,10-Mar-18 01:22 PM,but tbh I was just hitting majors at random,
Chafos#1781,10-Mar-18 01:23 PM,randomly hitting a button sounds like a great way to choose a major,
MEE6#4876,10-Mar-18 01:23 PM,"GG @Chafos#1781, you just advanced to level 8!",
Cole#0059,10-Mar-18 01:23 PM,"haha, I chose Aerospace Engineering, and I'm gonna try a semester with it, but if things don't work out, I'm going to try to apply to Chemical engineering",
MEE6#4876,10-Mar-18 01:23 PM,"GG @Cole#0059, you just advanced to level 2!",
Arya201#6452,10-Mar-18 01:23 PM,I'm going to switch to MechE day 1 at uni,

Skfoos#9138,10-Mar-18 03:29 PM,It seems decently higher this year,
udishab#2211,10-Mar-18 03:30 PM,everyone ik who applied rd got waitlisted or rejected :/,
Skfoos#9138,10-Mar-18 03:30 PM,Tbh I think a lot more waitlisted people will get in,
Skfoos#9138,10-Mar-18 03:30 PM,Relative to other years,
jakchoy#8192,10-Mar-18 03:49 PM,@Arya201#6452 if you check the 22 class fb page i posted it today,
Rachit#8477,10-Mar-18 04:05 PM,"OK, just found this page! Haha, not all RD applicants got waitlisted / rejected, @udishab#2211.",
Thedarkbobman#8576,10-Mar-18 04:19 PM,@udishab#2211  i know the feel,
angrymunch739#7866,10-Mar-18 04:48 PM,Is the waitlist a realistic way of getting into tech? How many people get in through wait-list?,
Rachit#8477,10-Mar-18 04:48 PM,"Ahh, this group is way too silent! Any new admits around?",
MEE6#4876,10-Mar-18 04:48 PM,"GG @Rachit#8477, you just advanced to level 1!",
angrymunch739#7866,10-Mar-18 04:49 PM,Welcome Rachit,
Mdmarshmallow#4695,10-Mar-18 04:49 PM,i read somewhere that it was 20%,
Mdmarshmallow#4695,10-Mar-18 04:49 PM,i think it was reddit so take it with a grain of salt,
angrymunch739#7866,10-Mar-18 04:49 PM,For wait list,
Mdmarshmallow#4695,10-Mar-18 04:50 PM,yah,
angrymunch739#7866,10-Mar-18 04:50 PM,How many people are on the gt wait list approximately?,
Rachit#8477,10-Mar-18 04:50 PM,"Hmm, that's interesting! It sounds basically the same admit rate (as compared to the overall admit rate).",
angrymunch739#7866,10-Mar-18 04:50 PM,We cmpe major aye!,
Mdmarshmallow#4695,10-Mar-18 04:51 PM,lol yah,

Mdmarshmallow#4695,10-Mar-18 04:51 PM,nope,
Rachit#8477,10-Mar-18 04:51 PM,"@angrymunch739#7866, there might be many! I've seen too many waitlisted people here, as compared to the admitted candidates.",
Rachit#8477,10-Mar-18 04:52 PM,"@Mdmarshmallow#4695, lol, what choice did you opt for while applying?",
Mdmarshmallow#4695,10-Mar-18 04:52 PM,comp e,
MEE6#4876,10-Mar-18 04:52 PM,"GG @Mdmarshmallow#4695, you just advanced to level 1!",
angrymunch739#7866,10-Mar-18 04:52 PM,"Like in the past tho, like 1,000? Or what",
Mdmarshmallow#4695,10-Mar-18 04:52 PM,my parents didnt want me to do cs,
Mdmarshmallow#4695,10-Mar-18 04:52 PM,so they made me do comp e instead,
Mdmarshmallow#4695,10-Mar-18 04:53 PM,idk why,
udishab#2211,10-Mar-18 04:53 PM,i also heard some people r admitted for the summer 2018 term instead of fall,
waffle.dynasty#2740,10-Mar-18 04:53 PM,Weird,
angrymunch739#7866,10-Mar-18 04:53 PM,Why does ur parents have to control you tho?,
Mdmarshmallow#4695,10-Mar-18 04:53 PM,yah lol,
Mdmarshmallow#4695,10-Mar-18 04:53 PM,they dont really,

Mdmarshmallow#4695,10-Mar-18 04:53 PM,i couldve done comp sci if i wanted to,
waffle.dynasty#2740,10-Mar-18 04:53 PM,You can switch tho,
Mdmarshmallow#4695,10-Mar-18 04:53 PM,but i was like whatever they probably know what they are talking about,
udishab#2211,10-Mar-18 04:53 PM,lmao i heard most ppl in compE just switch to cs bc it's too hard,
angrymunch739#7866,10-Mar-18 04:53 PM,Guys whats the wait list hope looking like this year?,
Chafos#1781,10-Mar-18 04:54 PM,I was originally going to do comp e but I realized I don’t like engineering lol. And then I started to like cs a lot so here I am,
angrymunch739#7866,10-Mar-18 04:54 PM,"I know tech admitted 4,000 students ea how many were admitted rd?",
Rachit#8477,10-Mar-18 04:55 PM,"Lol, same was the case with me, though I decided to go ahead with CS simply because I felt it might be the right fit for me. I hardly like studying about hardware. Now compare it with my love for coding, and you have the reason why one might take CS over CEng.",
Mdmarshmallow#4695,10-Mar-18 04:55 PM,comp e has coding in it tho,
Mdmarshmallow#4695,10-Mar-18 04:55 PM,j low level stuff,
angrymunch739#7866,10-Mar-18 04:55 PM,Yeah,
Mdmarshmallow#4695,10-Mar-18 04:55 PM,i figured ill take higher level languages on the side,

Rachit#8477,10-Mar-18 04:55 PM,"@angrymunch739#7866, where did you get that figure from?",
Mdmarshmallow#4695,10-Mar-18 04:55 PM,California,
angrymunch739#7866,10-Mar-18 04:55 PM,It was an article in January,

waffle.dynasty#2740,10-Mar-18 04:56 PM,Why did you guys apply RD? Just procrastinated or...,
angrymunch739#7866,10-Mar-18 04:56 PM,Deferred could be an explanation,
Mdmarshmallow#4695,10-Mar-18 04:56 PM,procrastination probably,
autumno#5107,10-Mar-18 04:56 PM,deferred....,
Mdmarshmallow#4695,10-Mar-18 04:56 PM,actually,
Mdmarshmallow#4695,10-Mar-18 04:56 PM,for me,
Mdmarshmallow#4695,10-Mar-18 04:56 PM,it was procrastination,
angrymunch739#7866,10-Mar-18 04:57 PM,So for the oos ppl have you been to tech?,
Mdmarshmallow#4695,10-Mar-18 04:57 PM,once,

angrymunch739#7866,10-Mar-18 04:58 PM,You committed to tech?,
Mdmarshmallow#4695,10-Mar-18 04:58 PM,no,

udishab#2211,10-Mar-18 04:59 PM,how many of you guys r likely gonna go to tech,
Mdmarshmallow#4695,10-Mar-18 04:59 PM,ucla and cal are my other big ones,
Mdmarshmallow#4695,10-Mar-18 04:59 PM,i have a few private reaches,
Mdmarshmallow#4695,10-Mar-18 04:59 PM,but too much $,
angrymunch739#7866,10-Mar-18 05:00 PM,I already paid my deposit back in January and it's non refundable so tech is my school,
Mdmarshmallow#4695,10-Mar-18 05:01 PM,ah so you were EA?,
angrymunch739#7866,10-Mar-18 05:01 PM,Yeah,
Mdmarshmallow#4695,10-Mar-18 05:01 PM,I EA'd MIT,
Mdmarshmallow#4695,10-Mar-18 05:01 PM,gonna take an L,
Rachit#8477,10-Mar-18 05:01 PM,"BTW, how many students does GeorgiaTech send offer letters to each year, guys?",
Mdmarshmallow#4695,10-Mar-18 05:02 PM,8000,

Rachit#8477,10-Mar-18 05:02 PM,"Woah, that's some number! And any idea about internationals?",
Mdmarshmallow#4695,10-Mar-18 05:02 PM,i was much more nervous for this decision than I was for MIT,
Mdmarshmallow#4695,10-Mar-18 05:02 PM,*am,
udishab#2211,10-Mar-18 05:02 PM,i feel like international acceptance rate is like 5%,
Chafos#1781,10-Mar-18 05:03 PM,I wouldn’t be surprised,
Mdmarshmallow#4695,10-Mar-18 05:03 PM,is there a difference between international and oos tuition,
Rachit#8477,10-Mar-18 05:03 PM,"Woah, really? That's strange! Does it go even lower for India?",
Mdmarshmallow#4695,10-Mar-18 05:04 PM,also does anyone know what the oos acceptance rate was?,
MEE6#4876,10-Mar-18 05:04 PM,"GG @Mdmarshmallow#4695, you just advanced to level 2!",
Rachit#8477,10-Mar-18 05:04 PM,"@Mdmarshmallow#4695, lol, a ton of difference! There isn't any difference in the tuition, but the acceptance rates usually tend to be lower for internationals.",

udishab#2211,10-Mar-18 05:04 PM,oos was 19% for ea,

Rye#0666,10-Mar-18 07:24 PM,Overall acceptance this year was 22%. EA was 26%. I think both rounds admitted roughly similar numbers of students so RD must've been below 20%,
Cole#0059,10-Mar-18 07:26 PM,wait does that 8000 accepted in RD include those that were accepted in EA?,
8726andrew#5709,10-Mar-18 07:27 PM,Does it specify rd?,

Rye#0666,10-Mar-18 10:35 PM,The next day I went to the campus though,
Arya201#6452,10-Mar-18 10:36 PM,Aww,
Arya201#6452,10-Mar-18 10:36 PM,I didn't party too much either,
Arya201#6452,10-Mar-18 10:36 PM,Except shed some legit tears of overjoy,

kk4jrq#5652,11-Mar-18 12:08 AM,3 times late is a detention,
Arya201#6452,11-Mar-18 01:02 AM,Ahh,
Arya201#6452,11-Mar-18 01:03 AM,We have another thing. 3 days late in a row=1 day marked absent even tho you show up,
Arya201#6452,11-Mar-18 01:03 AM,"Although, they aren't very strict about any rules except the anti bubbying policies",
Arya201#6452,11-Mar-18 01:04 AM,Bullying*,
kk4jrq#5652,11-Mar-18 01:04 AM,Wow...,
kk4jrq#5652,11-Mar-18 01:05 AM,I get a detention if I don't wear a belt to school or dont tuck my shirt in...,

Arya201#6452,11-Mar-18 01:08 AM,Like events and stuff,
Arya201#6452,11-Mar-18 01:08 AM,"But in normal days, it's the same white uniform",
kk4jrq#5652,11-Mar-18 01:09 AM,We can wear jeans on Fridays because we are seniors,
kk4jrq#5652,11-Mar-18 01:09 AM,That's about it,
Arya201#6452,11-Mar-18 01:32 AM,Nope,
Arya201#6452,11-Mar-18 01:32 AM,We can't do that,
Arya201#6452,11-Mar-18 01:32 AM,"We can wear other stuff on like victory day, independence day, mother language day, class party duhh, and ...",
Arya201#6452,11-Mar-18 01:33 AM,Nothing else tbh,
Rachit#8477,11-Mar-18 01:38 AM,"Lol, you guys are lucky! In India, it's the same uniform throughout the year!",
Arya201#6452,11-Mar-18 01:38 AM,"I know, been there",
Arya201#6452,11-Mar-18 01:38 AM,I attended City Montessori School for some competitions,
Arya201#6452,11-Mar-18 01:39 AM,they are super strict with uniforms and nails and hair and eye brows and what not,
Rachit#8477,11-Mar-18 01:39 AM,"Where are you located, Arya? Someone told me that you're a native of Bangladesh.",
Rachit#8477,11-Mar-18 01:39 AM,"Haha, Indian schools are super-strict!",
Arya201#6452,11-Mar-18 01:40 AM,yeah,

Arya201#6452,11-Mar-18 01:41 AM,should leave the topic for deep talk room tho smh,
Rachit#8477,11-Mar-18 01:42 AM,"Haha, sure! This chat would otherwise  convert into a philosophical talk.",
Rye#0666,11-Mar-18 11:30 AM,We don't have uniforms at my school,
kk4jrq#5652,11-Mar-18 11:53 AM,You are very lucky,

DanniC#6903,11-Mar-18 01:27 PM,Does anyone know what is the process of transferring majors? I was admitted with a biology major but now I want to transfer into engineering program...,
udishab#2211,11-Mar-18 01:29 PM,"you have to do this transfer form and then they have to accept it, i think people usually switch by second sem",
Rye#0666,11-Mar-18 01:39 PM,@DanniC#6903 Switching is pretty easy too if you do it early,
DanniC#6903,11-Mar-18 01:43 PM,Ahh thanks y'all,
DanniC#6903,11-Mar-18 01:44 PM,"But when is considered ""early"" though",
Rye#0666,11-Mar-18 01:45 PM,Probably within your first year,
Rye#0666,11-Mar-18 01:46 PM,I'm not sure,
Rye#0666,11-Mar-18 01:46 PM,But I just heard it's a lot easier to do it earlier,
kk4jrq#5652,11-Mar-18 01:46 PM,Switching after your first semester is considered early,
kk4jrq#5652,11-Mar-18 01:46 PM,Usually you've just taken core so it's not a big deal,
kk4jrq#5652,11-Mar-18 01:46 PM,Usually by 2nd semester you're taking some major classes so it makes it a little more difficult.,
DanniC#6903,11-Mar-18 01:52 PM,Ahhh I see,
MEE6#4876,11-Mar-18 01:52 PM,"GG @DanniC#6903, you just advanced to level 1!",
DanniC#6903,11-Mar-18 01:53 PM,Hahahaha yea thanks y'all,
Arya201#6452,11-Mar-18 01:53 PM,Welcome new peeps 😄 😄,
DanniC#6903,11-Mar-18 01:55 PM,I just saw on the website that I will get a withdrawal grade for courses I take in fall semester if I decided to change. Will a W grade effect me?,
DanniC#6903,11-Mar-18 01:55 PM,Thanks I am very excited!!,
Arya201#6452,11-Mar-18 01:55 PM,Is the course related to the major you have selected?,
DanniC#6903,11-Mar-18 01:56 PM,I don't know yet 😂😂 I haven't selected any courses,
Arya201#6452,11-Mar-18 01:56 PM,Ahh I see,
Arya201#6452,11-Mar-18 01:56 PM,What are you majoring in?,
DanniC#6903,11-Mar-18 01:56 PM,So if they are related I don't need to drop the class?,
Arya201#6452,11-Mar-18 01:56 PM,I believe so,
DanniC#6903,11-Mar-18 01:56 PM,I was admitted with biology major,
Arya201#6452,11-Mar-18 01:57 PM,"That's cool,",
Rye#0666,11-Mar-18 01:57 PM,Join aerospace so we can be the largest major on the Discord,
DanniC#6903,11-Mar-18 01:57 PM,I want to do either BME or Environmental engineering although I know they are very competitive to get in,
DanniC#6903,11-Mar-18 01:57 PM,Hahahaha,
Rye#0666,11-Mar-18 01:57 PM,We're like 40 behind CS 😭,
Arya201#6452,11-Mar-18 01:57 PM,Aerospace sounds cool tbh,
Rye#0666,11-Mar-18 01:58 PM,Honestly I'm really surprised AE is so big,
Rye#0666,11-Mar-18 01:58 PM,I didn't think it would be,
Arya201#6452,11-Mar-18 01:58 PM,Cooler than CS but May be that's just me,
kk4jrq#5652,11-Mar-18 01:58 PM,I though more people would be ECE than there are... Very few EE especially,
DanniC#6903,11-Mar-18 01:59 PM,Hahahahaha honestly I have no idea what major suits me and that's why I ended up wanting to change major so early,
Rye#0666,11-Mar-18 01:59 PM,That's fine. Plenty of people change their majors,
Rye#0666,11-Mar-18 02:00 PM,"My dad started as a biochem major on a premed track the dropped out, owned a restaurant his uncle gave him (bad idea), went back to school for accounting, and then became a tax lawyer",
Arya201#6452,11-Mar-18 02:00 PM,Danni you're not alone. I'm switching too and that's for sure,
DanniC#6903,11-Mar-18 02:00 PM,I want to be in medical field so I chose biology thinking it's related to medicine but I learned that it is very hard to find a job with a biology degree,
Arya201#6452,11-Mar-18 02:01 PM,Ryan that's interesting lol,
DanniC#6903,11-Mar-18 02:01 PM,That is interesting,

DanniC#6903,11-Mar-18 02:04 PM,Ohh cool,
Arya201#6452,11-Mar-18 02:04 PM,But I selected the wrong major,
Arya201#6452,11-Mar-18 02:04 PM,I can tell,
DanniC#6903,11-Mar-18 02:05 PM,What major are you in,
MEE6#4876,11-Mar-18 02:05 PM,"GG @DanniC#6903, you just advanced to level 2!",

angrymunch739#7866,11-Mar-18 04:56 PM,So cole are you comitted to tech?,
Cole#0059,11-Mar-18 04:56 PM,most likely,
Cole#0059,11-Mar-18 04:57 PM,like 95% sure,
angrymunch739#7866,11-Mar-18 04:57 PM,"@Cole#0059 thats good, ita right by Midtown and you can enjoy the city while you're at it",
waffle.dynasty#2740,11-Mar-18 04:57 PM,"I've never been to Notre Dame, but if it's anything like the rest of the state it sucks",
waffle.dynasty#2740,11-Mar-18 04:57 PM,It's a good school,
waffle.dynasty#2740,11-Mar-18 04:57 PM,Bad location,

Cole#0059,11-Mar-18 04:59 PM,"haha well don't get me wrong. its a good school, and really good community. but I guess when I got denied, it kinda shocked me and my entire school. legit everyone thought I would get in. but I guess everything happens for a reason you know",
angrymunch739#7866,11-Mar-18 05:00 PM,"Yeah, are you top of your class?",
Cole#0059,11-Mar-18 05:01 PM,"top 10%... i go to a private school, so my senior class is 57 students. but I'm doing well for it",

Cole#0059,11-Mar-18 05:03 PM,no one at my school is interested in engineering except for me,
angrymunch739#7866,11-Mar-18 05:03 PM,Thats cool,
Cole#0059,11-Mar-18 05:04 PM,"i guess, but I'll be makin all new friends haha rip",

Perditus#2503,11-Mar-18 05:12 PM,So uh I have an awkward hard to answer question,
Cole#0059,11-Mar-18 05:12 PM,"ok, shoot",
angrymunch739#7866,11-Mar-18 05:13 PM,Ask,
angrymunch739#7866,11-Mar-18 05:13 PM,Im from Georgia!,
angrymunch739#7866,11-Mar-18 05:13 PM,Whats your question,
Perditus#2503,11-Mar-18 05:13 PM,"Awesome. What are the major differences between GA Tech and Berkeley (EECS), culturally, academically, etc. ?",
Cole#0059,11-Mar-18 05:14 PM,hm... that is hard 😂,
Perditus#2503,11-Mar-18 05:14 PM,I’m trying to decide and I know next to nothing about GA Tech 😦,
Cole#0059,11-Mar-18 05:14 PM,I don't know much about Berkeley,
angrymunch739#7866,11-Mar-18 05:14 PM,I don't know to much about Berkeley,
Cole#0059,11-Mar-18 05:14 PM,but I have some ideas about Tech,
angrymunch739#7866,11-Mar-18 05:14 PM,Same :),
Cole#0059,11-Mar-18 05:14 PM,haha you first,
angrymunch739#7866,11-Mar-18 05:15 PM,My sibling also attends tech so I do have some ideas,
Perditus#2503,11-Mar-18 05:16 PM,Anything would b super helpful. Just trying to gather some info,
Rye#0666,11-Mar-18 05:16 PM,I applied to UC Berkeley too,
MEE6#4876,11-Mar-18 05:16 PM,"GG @Rye#0666, you just advanced to level 17!",
Rye#0666,11-Mar-18 05:16 PM,Wonderful,
Rye#0666,11-Mar-18 05:16 PM,I'm not going though,
Rye#0666,11-Mar-18 05:16 PM,Because I already committed to GT :SquidDab:,
Perditus#2503,11-Mar-18 05:17 PM,Nice,
Cole#0059,11-Mar-18 05:17 PM,well @Perditus#2503 I'm assuming that your going into an engineering major for both schools right?,
Perditus#2503,11-Mar-18 05:17 PM,Yes,
angrymunch739#7866,11-Mar-18 05:18 PM,Tech has great traditions which can help freshman Connect together including the  freshman cake walk,
Perditus#2503,11-Mar-18 05:18 PM,So like I heard Berkeley Engineering is super stressful and competitive and not fun at all. Is it like that at GA Tech?,
Rye#0666,11-Mar-18 05:18 PM,Yes,
Rye#0666,11-Mar-18 05:18 PM,I think,
angrymunch739#7866,11-Mar-18 05:18 PM,Gt is also stressful dont get me wrong,
Rye#0666,11-Mar-18 05:18 PM,Georgia Tech is known to be hard,
Cole#0059,11-Mar-18 05:18 PM,"well for engineering, Georgia Tech's education is literally the best in the country, except for MIT... but still",
angrymunch739#7866,11-Mar-18 05:18 PM,It is known to have grade deflation,
angrymunch739#7866,11-Mar-18 05:18 PM,But thats good,
Rye#0666,11-Mar-18 05:18 PM,But a lot of students like GT,
Rye#0666,11-Mar-18 05:19 PM,And it can be very rewarding to graduate,
angrymunch739#7866,11-Mar-18 05:19 PM,It makes a degree from tech valuable,
Perditus#2503,11-Mar-18 05:19 PM,Yeah grade deflation is great if u manage to do well,
angrymunch739#7866,11-Mar-18 05:19 PM,Engineering degree from tech is one of the best,
Cole#0059,11-Mar-18 05:19 PM,theres a ton of activities for students and a rec center and a great gym btw... the rooms are decent and all,
Cole#0059,11-Mar-18 05:20 PM,dorms*,
angrymunch739#7866,11-Mar-18 05:20 PM,Yeah the CRC is a great place too,
Perditus#2503,11-Mar-18 05:20 PM,Ok let’s skip to the chase,
angrymunch739#7866,11-Mar-18 05:20 PM,Ok,
Perditus#2503,11-Mar-18 05:20 PM,Hows the food,
Rye#0666,11-Mar-18 05:21 PM,Uhh,
angrymunch739#7866,11-Mar-18 05:21 PM,Well people say it isn't the best,
angrymunch739#7866,11-Mar-18 05:21 PM,Tbh,
Rye#0666,11-Mar-18 05:21 PM,Pretty meh,
Cole#0059,11-Mar-18 05:21 PM,"oh... haha its ok i guess. but you gotta remember that its in the middle of Atlanta, so there are a ton of places to go eat around",
Rye#0666,11-Mar-18 05:21 PM,But Atlanta has a lot of good restaurants,
Rye#0666,11-Mar-18 05:21 PM,Most people just complain about the dining halls,
waffle.dynasty#2740,11-Mar-18 05:21 PM,"I've been to campus a couple times and thought the food was great, but I've heard bad things from students",
angrymunch739#7866,11-Mar-18 05:21 PM,Yeah thats true,
Perditus#2503,11-Mar-18 05:21 PM,Ok fair enough,
Rye#0666,11-Mar-18 05:21 PM,/r/gatech was kinda blowing up about one of the dining halls lol,
Rye#0666,11-Mar-18 05:21 PM,I forgot which one,

waffle.dynasty#2740,11-Mar-18 05:22 PM,West Village,
Perditus#2503,11-Mar-18 05:22 PM,Anyone have an idea of the quality of the CS career fair? How many companies recruit there and r they aggressive?,
Rye#0666,11-Mar-18 05:22 PM,Yeah avoid West Village,
Cole#0059,11-Mar-18 05:22 PM,I don't really know about that career fair question,
Perditus#2503,11-Mar-18 05:22 PM,Ok no west village got it,
Cole#0059,11-Mar-18 05:22 PM,sorry...,

Quantum#1480,11-Mar-18 05:23 PM,I've heard the career fair is pretty extensive,
angrymunch739#7866,11-Mar-18 05:23 PM,You can always ask gatech subreddit they have current students and etc who can more precisely answer your question,
Rye#0666,11-Mar-18 05:23 PM,Yeah /r/gatech will be more helpful than most of us,
Rye#0666,11-Mar-18 05:23 PM,https://www.reddit.com/r/gatech/,
Perditus#2503,11-Mar-18 05:23 PM,Thanks @angrymunch739#7866 and @Rye#0666 ! Will do that,

Rye#0666,11-Mar-18 05:24 PM,I lurk there sometimes and it's pretty helpful,
kk4jrq#5652,11-Mar-18 05:24 PM,Idk why people hate Willage so much.m I've been a few times and it's pretty decent,
angrymunch739#7866,11-Mar-18 05:24 PM,They have experience and will be more willing to answer your specific questions,
kk4jrq#5652,11-Mar-18 05:24 PM,Better than my HS food,
Rye#0666,11-Mar-18 05:24 PM,Could be just exaggerated,
Rye#0666,11-Mar-18 05:24 PM,"If it's anything like my high school, that's pretty easy to beat",
kk4jrq#5652,11-Mar-18 05:24 PM,Or it could be students complaining like students tend to do lol,
Rye#0666,11-Mar-18 05:24 PM,Yeah,
kk4jrq#5652,11-Mar-18 05:25 PM,Cuz let's be real we all throw a ton of shade at our schools.,
Rye#0666,11-Mar-18 05:25 PM,Some people like to complain just to complain,
angrymunch739#7866,11-Mar-18 05:25 PM,Well people say its overpriced food,
angrymunch739#7866,11-Mar-18 05:25 PM,unreasonable serving sizes,
Perditus#2503,11-Mar-18 05:25 PM,"Ok last thing. Hows the demographics of Engineering students at GA Tech? I’m assuming mostly Asians and some whites, like Berkeley?",
Perditus#2503,11-Mar-18 05:25 PM,And mostly male?,
kk4jrq#5652,11-Mar-18 05:26 PM,It's a pretty good mix,
kk4jrq#5652,11-Mar-18 05:26 PM,Mostly male in engineering,
Quantum#1480,11-Mar-18 05:26 PM,it's def more demographically balanced than Berkeley,
Rye#0666,11-Mar-18 05:26 PM,It's probably mostly male,
Perditus#2503,11-Mar-18 05:26 PM,So on a scale of virginity to partying.......,
Quantum#1480,11-Mar-18 05:26 PM,in terms of race,
Cole#0059,11-Mar-18 05:26 PM,"ya, roughly 60-40 in favor of males",
angrymunch739#7866,11-Mar-18 05:26 PM,When I was at tech there was definitely a mix of males and females.  The race is is also mix,
Rye#0666,11-Mar-18 05:27 PM,Depends on your classes,
kk4jrq#5652,11-Mar-18 05:27 PM,But they have a lot of girls in non engineering,
Perditus#2503,11-Mar-18 05:27 PM,That’s actually not awful @Cole#0059,
Rye#0666,11-Mar-18 05:27 PM,"If you're in the liberal arts college, there's probably more females",
Cole#0059,11-Mar-18 05:27 PM,@Perditus#2503 for an engineering school its pretty good!,
kk4jrq#5652,11-Mar-18 05:27 PM,Yeah the ratio flips,
Perditus#2503,11-Mar-18 05:27 PM,Do the Engineering students mix with the non-Engineering females,
angrymunch739#7866,11-Mar-18 05:27 PM,So what majors have the most unbalance? For gender,
Rye#0666,11-Mar-18 05:27 PM,I do the distance math program with GT and it seems pretty even in there,
Cole#0059,11-Mar-18 05:27 PM,haha I think thats a reddit question,
Perditus#2503,11-Mar-18 05:27 PM,Ya probly,
kk4jrq#5652,11-Mar-18 05:28 PM,EE... It's like 20 percent female,
Rye#0666,11-Mar-18 05:28 PM,Linear algebra and multi calc are required for a lot of majors so that's probably why,
Rye#0666,11-Mar-18 05:28 PM,Expect your base classes to be much more varied,
Rye#0666,11-Mar-18 05:28 PM,"Once you go higher up in your engineering major and take classes designed specifically for your major, it probably becomes more males and whatnot",
Perditus#2503,11-Mar-18 05:29 PM,Eh this is why I wanna go to Yale or Vandy,
Perditus#2503,11-Mar-18 05:29 PM,Lol,
Cole#0059,11-Mar-18 05:29 PM,did you get in?,
Perditus#2503,11-Mar-18 05:29 PM,I didn’t apply to either cuz they’re low ranked in Engineering,
Cole#0059,11-Mar-18 05:29 PM,damn kid! you should of!,
Perditus#2503,11-Mar-18 05:30 PM,But still. Gender ratios are normal there,
Perditus#2503,11-Mar-18 05:30 PM,Lol ikr,
Cole#0059,11-Mar-18 05:30 PM,I applied to vandy,
Cole#0059,11-Mar-18 05:30 PM,but didn't go well lol rip,
Perditus#2503,11-Mar-18 05:30 PM,Ugh rip,
angrymunch739#7866,11-Mar-18 05:30 PM,Vanderbilt?,
Perditus#2503,11-Mar-18 05:30 PM,Ya,
Cole#0059,11-Mar-18 05:30 PM,ya,
angrymunch739#7866,11-Mar-18 05:30 PM,Ah,
Perditus#2503,11-Mar-18 05:30 PM,The famed Vandy girls,
angrymunch739#7866,11-Mar-18 05:30 PM,Vanderbilt is also a good school,
Cole#0059,11-Mar-18 05:30 PM,^ no doubt,
Perditus#2503,11-Mar-18 05:31 PM,Is it? Lol I wouldn’t even know,
Cole#0059,11-Mar-18 05:31 PM,whats like your biggest concern @Perditus#2503,
angrymunch739#7866,11-Mar-18 05:31 PM,I still prefer tech,
Rye#0666,11-Mar-18 05:32 PM,Yeah Vanderbilt is great overall,
Perditus#2503,11-Mar-18 05:32 PM,@Cole#0059 1) not being able to handle the stress of a top ranked Engineering program. 2) eternal virginity surrounded by fellow weebs,
Rye#0666,11-Mar-18 05:32 PM,Just stand out from the rest,
Cole#0059,11-Mar-18 05:32 PM,AHAHA,
angrymunch739#7866,11-Mar-18 05:32 PM,Weebs... Lol,
Perditus#2503,11-Mar-18 05:32 PM,or neoweeberals,
Perditus#2503,11-Mar-18 05:33 PM,They’re interesting,
Rye#0666,11-Mar-18 05:33 PM,"I heard from someone that as long as you dress decently and have good hygiene and you can talk to people without being awkward, you're better than a lot of guys lol",
Perditus#2503,11-Mar-18 05:33 PM,"I have decent social skills and dress decently plus hygiene, but I’m short and scrawny",
Cole#0059,11-Mar-18 05:34 PM,"well i can see your concern. Its a hard school don't get me wrong... but from what I've heard, there are a lot of opportunities to get help... so if your scared about failing out, if you put in a lot of effort, you should be ok... in terms of the latter... thats something I can't really help with bro 😂 @Perditus#2503",
Rye#0666,11-Mar-18 05:34 PM,I'm not necessarily short but under average. I really need to start working out though,
Rye#0666,11-Mar-18 05:34 PM,I'm like 5'9.5,
Cole#0059,11-Mar-18 05:34 PM,^ same,
angrymunch739#7866,11-Mar-18 05:34 PM,👏👏,

Rye#0666,11-Mar-18 05:34 PM,I'm gonna start exercising in the summer so I can create good habits when college starts,
Raj#6135,11-Mar-18 05:34 PM,"hey guys, im 5'4 and i can throw a javelin 150 feet, if i can do that, u guys can DEFINITELY get waaaaaaaay bigger than me",
Cole#0059,11-Mar-18 05:35 PM,DAMN!,

Cole#0059,11-Mar-18 05:39 PM,does Berkeley have a discord?,
Rye#0666,11-Mar-18 05:40 PM,They might have a main one for the school,
Rye#0666,11-Mar-18 05:40 PM,But I doubt one for the 2022 class considering admissions hasn't come out,
Rye#0666,11-Mar-18 05:40 PM,I don't think they come out until the end of the month,
angrymunch739#7866,11-Mar-18 05:40 PM,Anyone know when Clemson comes out,
Cole#0059,11-Mar-18 05:41 PM,oh ahah I see... they just aren't as cool as us @Perditus#2503,
Perditus#2503,11-Mar-18 05:41 PM,No i already got into Berkeley as an EECS major,

Chafos#1781,12-Mar-18 06:05 PM,"Essentially military intelligence involves the collection and interpretation of certain useful information for the purpose of guiding officers in making useful and informed military decisions, so my father has performed operations relating to that both directly and from a more executive standpoint as well.  Part of being an officer, assuming one advances up to colonel and beyond, is commanding divisions like batallions and brigades, so my father has done both of those.   He's worked a lot with NSA and US Cyber Command in various positions as well.  He's currently the commander of JIOC, which is the Joint Intelligence Operations Center, so in that role and as well as in the roles with NSA/Cyber Command he does do some top-secret classified stuff",

thedragonlegacy#2854,12-Mar-18 06:09 PM,"Thanks for the summary, and that's super doPE that he's in charge of top secret stuff. quite spicy. Didn't you say you'd be interning at NSA in the summer? @Chafos#1781",
Chafos#1781,12-Mar-18 06:11 PM,Yes I am!  And apparently I will have access to some of the top-secret information that my father hasn't been allowed to tell me all these years once I get my clearance,

thedragonlegacy#2854,12-Mar-18 06:17 PM,do you plan to have a career in the military?,

Chafos#1781,12-Mar-18 07:01 PM,I also like math and chemistry though so if I'm significantly pulled towards one of those fields in college I may change my mind career-wise,
Lennox#3038,12-Mar-18 07:04 PM,Have you taken linear algebra yet?,
Lennox#3038,12-Mar-18 07:05 PM,"Part of the course is looking at computer science math, like the google matrix",
Lennox#3038,12-Mar-18 07:05 PM,maybe you can get the best of both worlds,
8726andrew#5709,12-Mar-18 07:05 PM,if you're taking linear for your sake and for mine dont get lacey,

8726andrew#5709,12-Mar-18 07:09 PM,if its the same as how i took it it was kinda shitty,
Chafos#1781,12-Mar-18 07:09 PM,I really wanted to take multivariable at my school but because I transferred in the years didn't work out so they didn't let me,
8726andrew#5709,12-Mar-18 07:09 PM,but thats mostly bc my teacher was so bad,
8726andrew#5709,12-Mar-18 07:09 PM,rip,

Chafos#1781,12-Mar-18 07:10 PM,also they didn't let me take ap comp sci last year even though I got a perfect score on a practice test as a sophomore :/,
8726andrew#5709,12-Mar-18 07:10 PM,yeah lacey was pretty much worthless,
8726andrew#5709,12-Mar-18 07:10 PM,lol your school sounds dumb,
Lennox#3038,12-Mar-18 07:10 PM,yeah that seems rather silly,
Chafos#1781,12-Mar-18 07:11 PM,it was kinda dumb lol,
Chafos#1781,12-Mar-18 07:11 PM,except now ap comp sci is basically a free period which is nice for catching up on work,

angrymunch739#7866,12-Mar-18 09:18 PM,Sleep was terrible due to daylights savings tbh,
Chafos#1781,12-Mar-18 09:19 PM,started out rough with me falling asleep in a class but I made progress in a coding project and got to nap so it was pretty good at that point,
Chafos#1781,12-Mar-18 09:19 PM,yeah sleep was not good,
angrymunch739#7866,12-Mar-18 09:19 PM,Why do we even have day lights savings,
angrymunch739#7866,12-Mar-18 09:19 PM,Never knew why,
Lennox#3038,12-Mar-18 09:20 PM,The government does this every year because it causes the population to be really tired and groggy,
Lennox#3038,12-Mar-18 09:20 PM,then they dont notice all the experiments run,
Lennox#3038,12-Mar-18 09:20 PM,chafos will learn all about it soon,

Arya201#6452,13-Mar-18 02:10 AM,One subject gets a double period,
Arya201#6452,13-Mar-18 02:10 AM,And the rest of the time is free periods we can shit around the campus doing nothing,
Arya201#6452,13-Mar-18 02:11 AM,And exploring bits although there's nothing more left to be found,
joazlazer#2041,13-Mar-18 09:03 AM,Dang that's pretty cool,

Arya201#6452,13-Mar-18 10:24 AM,"yeah if the classes are long, they lose productivity",
kk4jrq#5652,13-Mar-18 11:01 AM,Most definitely,
mic#7575,13-Mar-18 11:09 AM,Our physics teacher gives us a five-minute break whenever we have two periods back-to-back,
kk4jrq#5652,13-Mar-18 11:10 AM,That's still crazy,
kk4jrq#5652,13-Mar-18 11:10 AM,How long are your periods?,

Arya201#6452,13-Mar-18 02:38 PM,:O,
Arya201#6452,13-Mar-18 02:38 PM,I think you're being tortured,
Arya201#6452,13-Mar-18 02:38 PM,This is child labour,
thedragonlegacy#2854,13-Mar-18 02:39 PM,i've had 90 min classes since sophomore year so it isnt much of a pain anymore,
thedragonlegacy#2854,13-Mar-18 02:39 PM,¯\_(ツ)_/¯,

Chafos#1781,13-Mar-18 05:10 PM,"I have 8 45-minute periods, monday through friday",
Chafos#1781,13-Mar-18 05:11 PM,your school's system seems pretty complicated to me but I guess you probably think the same of some of the other ones you're seeing lol @Lennox#3038,
Lennox#3038,13-Mar-18 05:15 PM,"A bunch of teachers and students think so, too",
Lennox#3038,13-Mar-18 05:16 PM,"in fact, they're canning it after this year in favor of a weird 8 period day with an hour long lunch + extended school day",
Lennox#3038,13-Mar-18 05:17 PM,"which is odd because we already get out pretty late (3:40), but whatever",
kk4jrq#5652,13-Mar-18 05:37 PM,That's so weird...,

MEE6#4876,13-Mar-18 10:49 PM,"GG @Lennox#3038, you just advanced to level 10!",
Lennox#3038,13-Mar-18 10:49 PM,when I was there they said they gave away all their books to emory,
Lennox#3038,13-Mar-18 10:49 PM,"whose library is awesome, if youve never been",
angrymunch739#7866,13-Mar-18 10:49 PM,I don't know if it is going to be an actual library,
angrymunch739#7866,13-Mar-18 10:50 PM,Maybe a study space/library,
angrymunch739#7866,13-Mar-18 10:50 PM,I think the side of the building is going to be all glass because last time I saw it they were putting up glass panels,
Lennox#3038,13-Mar-18 10:51 PM,I just want books D:,
angrymunch739#7866,13-Mar-18 10:51 PM,Lol its a digital age,
angrymunch739#7866,13-Mar-18 10:52 PM,So you like to read huh?,
angrymunch739#7866,13-Mar-18 10:52 PM,Haven't read for fun in a while,
Lennox#3038,13-Mar-18 10:52 PM,I don't read as often as I'd like,
Lennox#3038,13-Mar-18 10:53 PM,But the appeal of a university library is all the really old books and transcripts and stuff,
angrymunch739#7866,13-Mar-18 10:53 PM,Lennox sorry if I asked you this before but where are you from,
Lennox#3038,13-Mar-18 10:53 PM,GA,
Lennox#3038,13-Mar-18 10:53 PM,Cumming,
angrymunch739#7866,13-Mar-18 10:53 PM,Ah is that north ga,
Lennox#3038,13-Mar-18 10:54 PM,yessir,
Lennox#3038,13-Mar-18 10:54 PM,aren't you like kinda north ga?,
angrymunch739#7866,13-Mar-18 10:54 PM,"Yeah Cobb, Nw",
angrymunch739#7866,13-Mar-18 10:54 PM,North west,
angrymunch739#7866,13-Mar-18 10:54 PM,Hows Cummings never really been there,
Lennox#3038,13-Mar-18 10:55 PM,"It's nothing spectacular, but definitely not bad",
angrymunch739#7866,13-Mar-18 10:55 PM,Don't know about you guys but I got Early Release Tmmrw,
angrymunch739#7866,13-Mar-18 10:56 PM,"You guys participating in the school March out, just curious",
kk4jrq#5652,13-Mar-18 10:57 PM,I'm not...,
Lennox#3038,13-Mar-18 10:58 PM,I think my school is planning to let students wander around if they want,
kk4jrq#5652,13-Mar-18 10:58 PM,Yeah same here,
angrymunch739#7866,13-Mar-18 11:00 PM,Our school apparently will punish students who walk out due to interference of learning,
aquajet#7800,13-Mar-18 11:00 PM,wow,
aquajet#7800,13-Mar-18 11:01 PM,my school plans to hold a reflection/discussion in the gym,
angrymunch739#7866,13-Mar-18 11:01 PM,Possibly In school suspension,
thedragonlegacy#2854,13-Mar-18 11:02 PM,"I don't plan on participating. I think there needs to be more emphasis on improved safety technology, not just legislation",
kk4jrq#5652,13-Mar-18 11:03 PM,You can't legislate the world's problems away,
thedragonlegacy#2854,13-Mar-18 11:03 PM,"there's a whole field of potential for public safety tech, but it's not touched",
angrymunch739#7866,13-Mar-18 11:03 PM,I also agree that the solution is not just passing legislation,
kk4jrq#5652,13-Mar-18 11:04 PM,I mean and look at most of those shooters.... They got these guns illegaly,
kk4jrq#5652,13-Mar-18 11:04 PM,I love the idea of fingerprint triggers.,
thedragonlegacy#2854,13-Mar-18 11:04 PM,"and it shouldn't just be against guns, the public safety tech should aim to protect people from all weapons",
thedragonlegacy#2854,13-Mar-18 11:05 PM,"trucks, knives, machetes",
kk4jrq#5652,13-Mar-18 11:05 PM,It's not the guns that kill people.  It's the people that kill other people,
kk4jrq#5652,13-Mar-18 11:06 PM,I think the FBI is really to blame with this last shooting... There were so many warning signs and they did nothing,
Lennox#3038,13-Mar-18 11:12 PM,actually our classes change  when the walkout happens,
Lennox#3038,13-Mar-18 11:12 PM,guess I'm walking out no matter what,
Lennox#3038,13-Mar-18 11:13 PM,convenient timing,
kk4jrq#5652,13-Mar-18 11:30 PM,So is anyone else going to the Inventure thing tomorrow?  As far as I know it's just me and @thedragonlegacy#2854,

Lennox#3038,15-Mar-18 11:44 PM,although if we take Adrian's word than it can be rocked both ways,

Arya201#6452,18-Mar-18 01:41 PM,yeah tell them Duke students smoke weed 24/7,
Arya201#6452,18-Mar-18 01:42 PM,and most of them end up being pot farmers. And they will never ever ever ever want you to go to Duke.,
Cole#0059,18-Mar-18 01:42 PM,"lol well considering the people they know who did go to Duke are millionaires, i don't think they'll believe that 😂",
Arya201#6452,18-Mar-18 01:43 PM,just tell them exceptions arent examples,

Arya201#6452,18-Mar-18 01:44 PM,well you arent saying duke is bad if you think carefully,
Arya201#6452,18-Mar-18 01:44 PM,you're just saying you will be surrounded by high asf students,

Snowfish#4289,18-Mar-18 01:45 PM,oh no you poor soul,
Snowfish#4289,18-Mar-18 01:45 PM,weed just got decriminalized in atlanta like two months ago too,
Cole#0059,18-Mar-18 01:46 PM,"Ay, same in Vegas!",
Arya201#6452,18-Mar-18 01:46 PM,shush Cole's parents don't need to know that,
8726andrew#5709,18-Mar-18 01:46 PM,that and some of the real sketchy parts of atlanta are like right off campus too,
8726andrew#5709,18-Mar-18 01:46 PM,so its not like you couldnt find a guy,
Snowfish#4289,18-Mar-18 01:46 PM,yup,
Arya201#6452,18-Mar-18 01:46 PM,we need to convince Cole parents,
Cole#0059,18-Mar-18 01:46 PM,"I'm sure in the end I'll convince them that I'd rather go to GT, but i just can't commit right now",
Snowfish#4289,18-Mar-18 01:47 PM,are you out of state,
Cole#0059,18-Mar-18 01:47 PM,"ya, I'm from Vegas",
Snowfish#4289,18-Mar-18 01:47 PM,huh. yeah “i want to be closer to you guys” doesn’t work very well 🤔,
Cole#0059,18-Mar-18 01:48 PM,"I mean, I haven't even got into Duke yet, and there's probably a good chance i won't",
Cole#0059,18-Mar-18 01:48 PM,its all hypothetical,
Arya201#6452,18-Mar-18 01:48 PM,😐,
Snowfish#4289,18-Mar-18 01:48 PM,"i see you’re an AE major, does duke even have a good AE program?",
Arya201#6452,18-Mar-18 01:48 PM,No not at all,
Arya201#6452,18-Mar-18 01:48 PM,Cole tell that to your parents,
Cole#0059,18-Mar-18 01:48 PM,"i mean, they have one, but not comparable to GT",
Cole#0059,18-Mar-18 01:48 PM,I did,
Snowfish#4289,18-Mar-18 01:49 PM,whoop,
Cole#0059,18-Mar-18 01:49 PM,but they argued that making a college decisions based off rankings is a bad way to approach it,
Snowfish#4289,18-Mar-18 01:49 PM,they have a certificate,
Snowfish#4289,18-Mar-18 01:49 PM,that’s not true,
Cole#0059,18-Mar-18 01:49 PM,which i disagree with,
Snowfish#4289,18-Mar-18 01:49 PM,it’s less about rankings and more about learning tbh,
Snowfish#4289,18-Mar-18 01:49 PM,"if you’re not going to learn as well at one school, why would you go",
Snowfish#4289,18-Mar-18 01:49 PM,rankings reflect how well you will learn,
8726andrew#5709,18-Mar-18 01:50 PM,to an extent that arguement has merit,
MEE6#4876,18-Mar-18 01:50 PM,"GG @8726andrew#5709, you just advanced to level 17!",
Snowfish#4289,18-Mar-18 01:50 PM,"from what i’m seeing from duke, you need 5-6 classes to get AE on top of ME",
Snowfish#4289,18-Mar-18 01:50 PM,whereas at GT you have an entire major designed around it,
Snowfish#4289,18-Mar-18 01:50 PM,¯\_(ツ)_/¯,
8726andrew#5709,18-Mar-18 01:50 PM,like picking a school bc its #6 over the #7 school even tho you enjoyed the #7 better is dumb,
Snowfish#4289,18-Mar-18 01:51 PM,oh yeah definitely,
8726andrew#5709,18-Mar-18 01:51 PM,but if its like #6 vs #106 like thats a bit different,
Cole#0059,18-Mar-18 01:51 PM,"I could argue it like that, but I just gotta appease them and here back from Duke. In the end, it's my decision. I just sorta hope I get denied.",
8726andrew#5709,18-Mar-18 01:51 PM,and theres other factors too of course,
8726andrew#5709,18-Mar-18 01:51 PM,lol,
Snowfish#4289,18-Mar-18 01:52 PM,GT is #2 tho and i can’t even find duke on mobile,
Cole#0059,18-Mar-18 01:52 PM,"I also was maybe considering switching to chemical engineering depending on how i like my first semester, and ChemE for GT is 4th, which is still much better than Dukes",
Cole#0059,18-Mar-18 01:52 PM,I couldn't find Duke either,
Arya201#6452,18-Mar-18 01:52 PM,i wish GT started tomorrow,
Cole#0059,18-Mar-18 01:52 PM,I'm not sure if they are ranked,
Arya201#6452,18-Mar-18 01:53 PM,I dont like school anymore,
waffle.dynasty#2740,18-Mar-18 01:53 PM,Duke only has an Aerospace Certificate,
Cole#0059,18-Mar-18 01:53 PM,"I'll be back, I gotta go eat",
Arya201#6452,18-Mar-18 01:53 PM,no no don't eat cole,
Cole#0059,18-Mar-18 02:02 PM,hm... you guys are right about AE and ChemE at Tech... there much more involved,
Arya201#6452,18-Mar-18 02:03 PM,whats the job scopes for MechE in the states?,
Cole#0059,18-Mar-18 02:03 PM,I don't really know.... MechE never interested me,
Cole#0059,18-Mar-18 02:05 PM,so I haven't done much research about ti,
Cole#0059,18-Mar-18 02:05 PM,it,
Rye#0666,18-Mar-18 02:12 PM,@Arya201#6452 It's the most versatile engineering major iirc,
Rye#0666,18-Mar-18 02:13 PM,You can do lots of things with it,
Arya201#6452,18-Mar-18 02:13 PM,i like mechanics,
Arya201#6452,18-Mar-18 02:13 PM,but I just dont know the scopes with it in US,
Rye#0666,18-Mar-18 02:14 PM,"Do you mean like how many jobs there are and how sustainable it is, to say?",
Arya201#6452,18-Mar-18 02:14 PM,yeah,
waffle.dynasty#2740,18-Mar-18 02:14 PM,I feel like it would be easy to get a job with an ME degree,
Rye#0666,18-Mar-18 02:14 PM,https://www.bls.gov/ooh/architecture-and-engineering/mechanical-engineers.htm,
Rye#0666,18-Mar-18 02:14 PM,The BLS website is good to see statistics about careers,
Arya201#6452,18-Mar-18 02:15 PM,thanks Ryan,

Cole#0059,18-Mar-18 05:09 PM,"https://strawpoll.com/zwf4rrf9, me and my friends are having a very heated debate, so if you guys could participate in this poll, we'd appreciate it",
kk4jrq#5652,18-Mar-18 05:10 PM,What got you into this debate?,
waffle.dynasty#2740,18-Mar-18 05:10 PM,Oh my. So would I die if I saved the other person's life?,
Cole#0059,18-Mar-18 05:10 PM,yes,
Cole#0059,18-Mar-18 05:11 PM,"personally, i believe the other logic is so broken, but someone is trying to argue that if you're not will to give up your life for someone else, that moment defines you as a person who doesn't care for other people",
Cole#0059,18-Mar-18 05:11 PM,which i completely disagree with,
waffle.dynasty#2740,18-Mar-18 05:12 PM,"self·ish, , ˈselfiSH/, , adjective, , (of a person, action, or motive) lacking consideration for others; concerned chiefly with one's own personal profit or pleasure.",
waffle.dynasty#2740,18-Mar-18 05:13 PM,"Hmmm I would say you would be selfish by definition, but that's not necessarily a bad thing",
Cole#0059,18-Mar-18 05:14 PM,"but in this case, you're not gaining anything, you're keeping what you already had",
kk4jrq#5652,18-Mar-18 05:14 PM,But you aren't considering the fact that the other person is losing their life,
Cole#0059,18-Mar-18 05:14 PM,but his argument that this one extreme moment defines you as a selfish individual.... which is just completely crazy,
kk4jrq#5652,18-Mar-18 05:14 PM,I don't think its a bad thing.  Self-preservation is important to a degree,
waffle.dynasty#2740,18-Mar-18 05:15 PM,There's a reason they say to put in your oxygen mask on a plane first before helping others,
kk4jrq#5652,18-Mar-18 05:15 PM,"Of course, if it was like your sister/brother/family, I would say that has a totally different moral implication than just another person or even a friend.",
waffle.dynasty#2740,18-Mar-18 05:16 PM,I agree that your friend is being extreme,
Cole#0059,18-Mar-18 05:18 PM,"yes i agree to... but i think it is very unreasonable to say that if you don't give up your life for a stranger, to say that defines you as a selfish person is completely unreasonable because it is an extreme situation. and in stats like you have to ignore those situations",
Cole#0059,18-Mar-18 05:18 PM,because they don't represent the population,
kk4jrq#5652,18-Mar-18 05:19 PM,It is selfish but not wrong,
kk4jrq#5652,18-Mar-18 05:19 PM,That's my take on the issue,
waffle.dynasty#2740,18-Mar-18 05:19 PM,Yes,
Cole#0059,18-Mar-18 05:19 PM,I guess thats fair,
jakchoy#8192,18-Mar-18 07:48 PM,i agree with jordan on this,
jakchoy#8192,18-Mar-18 07:49 PM,"i think that it would be selfish since you're putting your own life ahead of others, but no one can judge which life is more worthy of saving",
jakchoy#8192,18-Mar-18 07:49 PM,if it can be judged at all,
mic#7575,18-Mar-18 08:44 PM,who is @Jace#4513 ?? interesting name,
Snowfish#4289,18-Mar-18 08:45 PM,rofl,

kk4jrq#5652,18-Mar-18 08:49 PM,Lol,

waffle.dynasty#2740,18-Mar-18 09:29 PM,50k next week let's go!!!,
8726andrew#5709,18-Mar-18 09:30 PM,does anyone understand how they make money,
Cole#0059,18-Mar-18 09:30 PM,lol there was a shoutout to GT,
8726andrew#5709,18-Mar-18 09:30 PM,like they have to profit in some way if they're increasing prize amounts,
8726andrew#5709,18-Mar-18 09:30 PM,but i dont see ads or anything and its a free app,
waffle.dynasty#2740,18-Mar-18 09:31 PM,Investors?,
8726andrew#5709,18-Mar-18 09:31 PM,investing in what lol,
8726andrew#5709,18-Mar-18 09:31 PM,what return,
8726andrew#5709,18-Mar-18 09:31 PM,literally its just a trivia show that gives away money through pay pal,
Cole#0059,18-Mar-18 09:32 PM,"Rus Yusupov, one of the app’s co-founders, told Variety that he’s seen “a ton of interest from brands and agencies who want to collaborate,” but they’ve never had any sponsored content or questions., , Instead, the company is backed by venture capital, a rep for HQ Trivia told Money, and is not currently focused on profitability. That means those jackpots are being paid out by deep-pocketed Silicon Valley investors who are betting the game will get big enough that, eventually, companies will pay to be associated with it.",
8726andrew#5709,18-Mar-18 09:32 PM,risky play,
8726andrew#5709,18-Mar-18 09:32 PM,might pay off tho,
waffle.dynasty#2740,18-Mar-18 09:32 PM,How big do they need to get,
Cole#0059,18-Mar-18 09:32 PM,i bet it will,
waffle.dynasty#2740,18-Mar-18 09:33 PM,There's like a million people every game,
Cole#0059,18-Mar-18 09:33 PM,"i dont know... but i mean if they just played some ads during the waiting period, they could make SO much money",
waffle.dynasty#2740,18-Mar-18 09:33 PM,Just having a company pay to put their name in a question would work,
waffle.dynasty#2740,18-Mar-18 09:33 PM,I mean most people remember the savage questions,
8726andrew#5709,18-Mar-18 09:34 PM,birds nest soup,
waffle.dynasty#2740,18-Mar-18 09:34 PM,"People still say ""birds nest""",
waffle.dynasty#2740,18-Mar-18 09:34 PM,Exactly,
waffle.dynasty#2740,18-Mar-18 09:34 PM,It's been like 3 weeks since that question,

Rye#0666,19-Mar-18 08:54 PM,Nope,
Rye#0666,19-Mar-18 08:54 PM,I don't own one,
Rye#0666,19-Mar-18 08:55 PM,But I'm gladly accepting donations for them,
kk4jrq#5652,19-Mar-18 08:57 PM,Next semester you'll have access to plently,
thedragonlegacy#2854,19-Mar-18 08:59 PM,i did a little,
thedragonlegacy#2854,19-Mar-18 09:00 PM,i also cant wait to have access xd i can print out gifts for people for free,
kk4jrq#5652,19-Mar-18 09:00 PM,Lol true,
kk4jrq#5652,19-Mar-18 09:00 PM,That's honestly the best thing about 3D printers... Easy family gifts that wow,
kk4jrq#5652,19-Mar-18 09:01 PM,"Just find a thing on thingeverse, then give it to them, say it's 3D printed.  Doesn't matter what it is cuz it's 3D printed",
aquajet#7800,19-Mar-18 09:02 PM,I heard about a guy who 3D printed his engagement ring.,
kk4jrq#5652,19-Mar-18 09:02 PM,That's pretty cool,
aquajet#7800,19-Mar-18 09:04 PM,"yea, his finance loved it, and he saved a ton of money",

aquajet#7800,19-Mar-18 09:04 PM,win-win,
kk4jrq#5652,19-Mar-18 09:04 PM,TrueTrue,
kk4jrq#5652,19-Mar-18 09:04 PM,3D printed stuff is so cheap,
Cole#0059,19-Mar-18 09:04 PM,finance and fiancé are two different things,
Cole#0059,19-Mar-18 09:05 PM,one sorta goes down as the other appears,
8726andrew#5709,19-Mar-18 09:05 PM,thats an oof,
kk4jrq#5652,19-Mar-18 09:05 PM,OOF,

kk4jrq#5652,19-Mar-18 09:34 PM,you right,
Caw#1913,19-Mar-18 09:34 PM,@kk4jrq#5652 I actually got a 3d printer for christmas last year and I've been messing around on it some,
Caw#1913,19-Mar-18 09:35 PM,I use it mainly for prototyping stuff that I build into full projects later,
kk4jrq#5652,19-Mar-18 09:35 PM,Sweet,
kk4jrq#5652,19-Mar-18 09:35 PM,What do you have?,
Caw#1913,19-Mar-18 09:36 PM,It's a Prusa i3 clone,
Caw#1913,19-Mar-18 09:36 PM,Let me find the exact model real quick,
kk4jrq#5652,19-Mar-18 09:36 PM,Nice,
kk4jrq#5652,19-Mar-18 09:36 PM,I just got the Prusa i3 Mk3,
Caw#1913,19-Mar-18 09:36 PM,Maker Select v2 maybe?,
Caw#1913,19-Mar-18 09:36 PM,Oh that thing is nice,
kk4jrq#5652,19-Mar-18 09:36 PM,I had the Makerbot Replicator 2x but I sold it cuz its crap,
kk4jrq#5652,19-Mar-18 09:36 PM,It was good when I bough it... But that was 4 years ago,
Caw#1913,19-Mar-18 09:37 PM,Yah the technology has gotten so much better since then,
Caw#1913,19-Mar-18 09:37 PM,Does yours have auto-level?,
kk4jrq#5652,19-Mar-18 09:37 PM,Yep,
Caw#1913,19-Mar-18 09:37 PM,Oh man I need that,
kk4jrq#5652,19-Mar-18 09:37 PM,It even auto calibrates halfway through the print if something gets a little off,
Caw#1913,19-Mar-18 09:38 PM,Most recent thing I used mine to make was a frame for my drone and I didn't level it good enough so I got through a 5 hour print to find it messed up on one of the arm supports,
MEE6#4876,19-Mar-18 09:38 PM,"GG @Caw#1913, you just advanced to level 1!",
Caw#1913,19-Mar-18 09:38 PM,What kind of stuff do you use yours for?,
kk4jrq#5652,19-Mar-18 09:38 PM,That sucks,
kk4jrq#5652,19-Mar-18 09:39 PM,Robot parts and just various odds and ends ideas,
kk4jrq#5652,19-Mar-18 09:39 PM,"Headphone stands, cases for something, custom bracket",
Caw#1913,19-Mar-18 09:39 PM,Whenever I first got it I used it just to print off stupid things off thingiverse,
kk4jrq#5652,19-Mar-18 09:39 PM,Same lol,
Caw#1913,19-Mar-18 09:39 PM,Like the weird gears and everything else,
kk4jrq#5652,19-Mar-18 09:39 PM,I just finished a planetary gear set for fun,
Caw#1913,19-Mar-18 09:40 PM,Like your own design?,
kk4jrq#5652,19-Mar-18 09:40 PM,Except it printed the whole set as 1 piece... No assembly... No supports...,
Caw#1913,19-Mar-18 09:40 PM,And rip to that,
kk4jrq#5652,19-Mar-18 09:40 PM,"Nah, someone elses.  I am doing testing calibration rn so just torturing it and learning the new printer",
kk4jrq#5652,19-Mar-18 09:40 PM,No... it's not a rip.,
kk4jrq#5652,19-Mar-18 09:40 PM,It moves perfectly.,
Caw#1913,19-Mar-18 09:40 PM,Wait,
Caw#1913,19-Mar-18 09:41 PM,Really?,
kk4jrq#5652,19-Mar-18 09:41 PM,But it was all one piece,
Caw#1913,19-Mar-18 09:41 PM,0.o,
Caw#1913,19-Mar-18 09:41 PM,I need that,
kk4jrq#5652,19-Mar-18 09:41 PM,Yeah...,
kk4jrq#5652,19-Mar-18 09:41 PM,It's literally insane,
kk4jrq#5652,19-Mar-18 09:41 PM,When I pulled it off and spun it my mind just exploded,
Caw#1913,19-Mar-18 09:41 PM,Next step is getting the ones that use the material you can wash away to print overhangs with no supports,
Caw#1913,19-Mar-18 09:42 PM,The maker space at Tech is going to be so cool,
kk4jrq#5652,19-Mar-18 09:42 PM,It is...,
kk4jrq#5652,19-Mar-18 09:42 PM,I'm hype for the new ECE one they are building,
Caw#1913,19-Mar-18 09:43 PM,What's special about it?,
kk4jrq#5652,19-Mar-18 09:47 PM,It's all just for electrical stuff,
Caw#1913,19-Mar-18 09:48 PM,Not as cool as NASA's pizza printer,
kk4jrq#5652,19-Mar-18 09:50 PM,True..........,
kk4jrq#5652,19-Mar-18 09:50 PM,Nothing is as cool as that,
Rye#0666,19-Mar-18 09:52 PM,It's not delivery. It's DiGiorno,
thedragonlegacy#2854,19-Mar-18 09:58 PM,pizza printer,

thedragonlegacy#2854,19-Mar-18 09:59 PM,nah,
thedragonlegacy#2854,19-Mar-18 10:00 PM,it seems like it would take too long,
kk4jrq#5652,19-Mar-18 10:00 PM,But like,
kk4jrq#5652,19-Mar-18 10:01 PM,As long as it's the same or faster than delivery,
kk4jrq#5652,19-Mar-18 10:01 PM,That's a win,
thedragonlegacy#2854,19-Mar-18 10:01 PM,why not just get dough and make pizza yourself,
kk4jrq#5652,19-Mar-18 10:01 PM,Bc I'm lazy,
thedragonlegacy#2854,19-Mar-18 10:02 PM,literally faster than waiting on a tiny needle to make a small pizza,
thedragonlegacy#2854,19-Mar-18 10:02 PM,lmao,
thedragonlegacy#2854,19-Mar-18 10:02 PM,or better yet,

kk4jrq#5652,19-Mar-18 10:02 PM,Costco is so far tho...,
kk4jrq#5652,19-Mar-18 10:02 PM,Little ceasers is 4 minutes from my house,
thedragonlegacy#2854,19-Mar-18 10:03 PM,do a drone delivery,
thedragonlegacy#2854,19-Mar-18 10:03 PM,i'm waiting for that to be a regular thing in our culture,
kk4jrq#5652,19-Mar-18 10:04 PM,It won't be anytime soon,
kk4jrq#5652,19-Mar-18 10:04 PM,Regulation and legal stuff is too messy and expensive to justify it,
kk4jrq#5652,19-Mar-18 10:04 PM,One day though,
kk4jrq#5652,19-Mar-18 10:04 PM,Then some kid will get killed by a drone and we will ban them all,
thedragonlegacy#2854,19-Mar-18 10:04 PM,oh shoot,
thedragonlegacy#2854,19-Mar-18 10:04 PM,that reminds me,
thedragonlegacy#2854,19-Mar-18 10:05 PM,"during one of my school event, we had a drone flying around the cafeteria",
thedragonlegacy#2854,19-Mar-18 10:05 PM,and it fell on a little kid 😰,
kk4jrq#5652,19-Mar-18 10:05 PM,Oh no...,
thedragonlegacy#2854,19-Mar-18 10:05 PM,drones are super fun tho,
thedragonlegacy#2854,19-Mar-18 10:07 PM,"i know a dude that is creating a drone startup, specifically building large drones for military use/tranportation",
thedragonlegacy#2854,19-Mar-18 10:07 PM,couldnt glean much info since the deats were a secret >_<,
Caw#1913,19-Mar-18 10:10 PM,Is that kid okay @thedragonlegacy#2854 ?,
thedragonlegacy#2854,19-Mar-18 10:10 PM,ahhh it was 4 years ago xD,
Caw#1913,19-Mar-18 10:10 PM,Practically yesterday,

kk4jrq#5652,21-Mar-18 11:06 AM,Heyyyy,
kk4jrq#5652,21-Mar-18 11:06 AM,Just finished my calc work wbu,
Arya201#6452,21-Mar-18 11:07 AM,"just finished my complex numbers homework, although the teacher doesn't care",
Arya201#6452,21-Mar-18 11:07 AM,and so tired,
Arya201#6452,21-Mar-18 11:07 AM,I wanna watch IT,
kk4jrq#5652,21-Mar-18 11:07 AM,Then do it,
Arya201#6452,21-Mar-18 11:08 AM,its scary 😐,
kk4jrq#5652,21-Mar-18 11:09 AM,Exactly,
kk4jrq#5652,21-Mar-18 11:09 AM,That's the point,
Arya201#6452,21-Mar-18 11:10 AM,yeah but I liked the scary,
Arya201#6452,21-Mar-18 11:10 AM,and I hate clowns,
Arya201#6452,21-Mar-18 11:10 AM,and this movie looks lit asf,
kk4jrq#5652,21-Mar-18 11:12 AM,Or read the book,
Rye#0666,21-Mar-18 11:36 AM,It wasn't scary,
Rye#0666,21-Mar-18 11:36 AM,I honestly was laughing a lot,
angrymunch739#7866,21-Mar-18 12:59 PM,Sup guys,
Ｐｒｅｓｉｄｅｎｔ Ｓｋｅｅｔ#0513,21-Mar-18 01:31 PM,Sup,
kk4jrq#5652,21-Mar-18 01:34 PM,Ayooo,
Rye#0666,21-Mar-18 02:29 PM,Hey,
Chafos#1781,21-Mar-18 02:33 PM,hi,
Ｐｒｅｓｉｄｅｎｔ Ｓｋｅｅｔ#0513,21-Mar-18 02:33 PM,how was your day?,
Chafos#1781,21-Mar-18 02:40 PM,mine was very nice.  got to sleep in because of a snow day,
angrymunch739#7866,21-Mar-18 03:36 PM,Was sup,
thedragonlegacy#2854,21-Mar-18 03:57 PM,":,> took my last physics test",
kk4jrq#5652,21-Mar-18 03:59 PM,Woohoo,
angrymunch739#7866,21-Mar-18 04:02 PM,"@thedragonlegacy#2854 thats good, what was it on",
angrymunch739#7866,21-Mar-18 04:03 PM,I just took a test on physics too (yesterday),
thedragonlegacy#2854,21-Mar-18 04:16 PM,"That’s not good, I only have 2 tests this semester",
thedragonlegacy#2854,21-Mar-18 04:16 PM,"Faraday, Lenz, LC Circuits",
kk4jrq#5652,21-Mar-18 04:31 PM,Yikes,
Ｐｒｅｓｉｄｅｎｔ Ｓｋｅｅｔ#0513,21-Mar-18 04:31 PM,^,
Thedarkbobman#8576,21-Mar-18 04:31 PM,you only have 2 tests?,
Thedarkbobman#8576,21-Mar-18 04:32 PM,how is the course structured,
Thedarkbobman#8576,21-Mar-18 04:32 PM,at least at my school we have lots of tests/quizzes depending on the class,
Thedarkbobman#8576,21-Mar-18 04:32 PM,and then a midterm and final that is weighed a lot,
thedragonlegacy#2854,21-Mar-18 04:38 PM,"it’s only emag, and half of the class is building circuits, labs, and playing with arduinos",
thedragonlegacy#2854,21-Mar-18 04:38 PM,"after this test, we have our final",
Chafos#1781,21-Mar-18 04:39 PM,yeesh we have 6 tests per semester,
Ｐｒｅｓｉｄｅｎｔ Ｓｋｅｅｔ#0513,21-Mar-18 04:39 PM,"but still, even my school has about 5 tests for emag. Although we don't do labs:frowning 2:",
Chafos#1781,21-Mar-18 04:40 PM,"our tests are 10 multiple choice questions, 3 ap-length short answers, and then 3 quizzes that are exact duplicates of homework problems (so grade boosters assuming you remember how to do the homework problem)",
Ｐｒｅｓｉｄｅｎｔ Ｓｋｅｅｔ#0513,21-Mar-18 04:40 PM,oh dang,
Ｐｒｅｓｉｄｅｎｔ Ｓｋｅｅｔ#0513,21-Mar-18 04:40 PM,that's a lot,
Chafos#1781,21-Mar-18 04:40 PM,yeah,
Chafos#1781,21-Mar-18 04:41 PM,and it also sucks when you miss half the lectures because ap bio and ap physics are double periods that overlap,
Ｐｒｅｓｉｄｅｎｔ Ｓｋｅｅｔ#0513,21-Mar-18 04:41 PM,Mine is between 5920 mc and 2 frq and we get 1 hw assignment per unit,
Ｐｒｅｓｉｄｅｎｔ Ｓｋｅｅｔ#0513,21-Mar-18 04:41 PM,*5-20,
Ｐｒｅｓｉｄｅｎｔ Ｓｋｅｅｔ#0513,21-Mar-18 04:41 PM,yikes my dude,
Chafos#1781,21-Mar-18 04:43 PM,yeah it's a fun time,
Chafos#1781,21-Mar-18 04:43 PM,playing with arduinos sounds like the type of physics class I want @thedragonlegacy#2854,
thedragonlegacy#2854,21-Mar-18 04:48 PM,it’s a lot of fun haha. my partner and I are making an ultrasonic alarm system rn,
thedragonlegacy#2854,21-Mar-18 04:49 PM,we had a total of 5 tests for emag,

Snowfish#4289,21-Mar-18 05:25 PM,stop being toxic,
Rye#0666,21-Mar-18 05:25 PM,Ban him,
Quantum#1480,21-Mar-18 05:26 PM,Yeah I'm fairly sure he's Oswald/Lerk reincarnate,
Rye#0666,21-Mar-18 05:26 PM,He's harassing people,
Snowfish#4289,21-Mar-18 05:26 PM,what happened,
Raj#6135,21-Mar-18 05:26 PM,blocking is so useful,
Rye#0666,21-Mar-18 05:26 PM,Check multiple channels,
Raj#6135,21-Mar-18 05:26 PM,he's just one of the trolls in hiding,
Snowfish#4289,21-Mar-18 05:26 PM,sigh,
Snowfish#4289,21-Mar-18 05:26 PM,cya,
Rye#0666,21-Mar-18 05:26 PM,Thank you,
kk4jrq#5652,21-Mar-18 05:26 PM,Thanks,
thedragonlegacy#2854,21-Mar-18 05:28 PM,:/ I had a feeling it was him,
thedragonlegacy#2854,21-Mar-18 05:28 PM,He was off,
Rye#0666,21-Mar-18 05:29 PM,What's up Marissa?,
thedragonlegacy#2854,21-Mar-18 05:31 PM,Just got home from robotics haha,
thedragonlegacy#2854,21-Mar-18 05:31 PM,"Hbu, what are you up to lately?",
Rye#0666,21-Mar-18 05:34 PM,Nothing much right now,
Rye#0666,21-Mar-18 05:34 PM,Gonna do some homework soon,
Rye#0666,21-Mar-18 05:34 PM,Not gonna be at school tomorrow,
Rye#0666,21-Mar-18 05:34 PM,Our band class is playing a Georgia State,
thedragonlegacy#2854,21-Mar-18 05:55 PM,oh? for what?,
thedragonlegacy#2854,21-Mar-18 05:56 PM,haha a portion of my orchestra is on a bus to disney,
thedragonlegacy#2854,21-Mar-18 05:56 PM,couldn't go since i'm about to be broke,
kk4jrq#5652,21-Mar-18 05:57 PM,Hey but u can play minecraft with us,
thedragonlegacy#2854,21-Mar-18 05:57 PM,o yuh,

Rye#0666,21-Mar-18 06:38 PM,Got in UC Santa Barbara :SquidDab:,
Tempelina#0898,21-Mar-18 07:06 PM,Anyone here in IB? Just curious,
MEE6#4876,21-Mar-18 07:06 PM,"GG @Tempelina#0898, you just advanced to level 1!",
Tempelina#0898,21-Mar-18 07:06 PM,I need to sympathize,
Chafos#1781,21-Mar-18 07:06 PM,I'm not in it but i hear it's rough,
Tempelina#0898,21-Mar-18 07:07 PM,Yeah it's like all of your classes are AP and I don't think having 7 IB classes (with art that makes 8 lol) is healthy,
Tempelina#0898,21-Mar-18 07:08 PM,But on the bright side I'll be super ready for tech,
8726andrew#5709,21-Mar-18 07:08 PM,its like ap but not ap at the same time,
8726andrew#5709,21-Mar-18 07:08 PM,no ap exams but other also shitty exams i assume?,
Tempelina#0898,21-Mar-18 07:08 PM,Pff the exams are crazy hard,
Chafos#1781,21-Mar-18 07:09 PM,haha I take 5 aps and 2 honors so I'm almost there,
Tempelina#0898,21-Mar-18 07:09 PM,Wow kudos man that's hard,
Chafos#1781,21-Mar-18 07:09 PM,"meh, really just physics and bio",
Chafos#1781,21-Mar-18 07:09 PM,maybe english,
Chafos#1781,21-Mar-18 07:09 PM,i could sleep in calc and comp sci,
8726andrew#5709,21-Mar-18 07:09 PM,bc is free,
8726andrew#5709,21-Mar-18 07:09 PM,physics 1 is a joke,
Tempelina#0898,21-Mar-18 07:10 PM,Bio is my hardest class and yet my favorite what is wrong with me,
Chafos#1781,21-Mar-18 07:10 PM,same!!,
8726andrew#5709,21-Mar-18 07:10 PM,C is harder for e and m but mechanics isnt free,
8726andrew#5709,21-Mar-18 07:10 PM,lang and lit are pretty chill,
Chafos#1781,21-Mar-18 07:10 PM,I love bio so much but the quizzes & tests are so hard,
Chafos#1781,21-Mar-18 07:10 PM,imma probably minor in biochem,
8726andrew#5709,21-Mar-18 07:10 PM,yeah bio is death,
Tempelina#0898,21-Mar-18 07:10 PM,Yes I can talk about bio shit all day,
8726andrew#5709,21-Mar-18 07:10 PM,took that freshman year lmao,
Tempelina#0898,21-Mar-18 07:10 PM,"Yeah me too, AP bio 9th grade",
Tempelina#0898,21-Mar-18 07:11 PM,Bad decision,
Chafos#1781,21-Mar-18 07:11 PM,oh geez,
Tempelina#0898,21-Mar-18 07:11 PM,Horrible time to take that class,
8726andrew#5709,21-Mar-18 07:11 PM,nah,
Chafos#1781,21-Mar-18 07:11 PM,how is that even allowed,
8726andrew#5709,21-Mar-18 07:11 PM,my school is special,
Chafos#1781,21-Mar-18 07:11 PM,i'm taking it this year,
8726andrew#5709,21-Mar-18 07:11 PM,they let us do it lol,
8726andrew#5709,21-Mar-18 07:11 PM,honestly was a nice wake up call,
8726andrew#5709,21-Mar-18 07:11 PM,nothing is hard after it tho,
Ｐｒｅｓｉｄｅｎｔ Ｓｋｅｅｔ#0513,21-Mar-18 07:11 PM,my school let freshmen do that once,
Tempelina#0898,21-Mar-18 07:11 PM,Except I B,
Chafos#1781,21-Mar-18 07:12 PM,yeah bio is definitely the hardest class I've ever taken,
8726andrew#5709,21-Mar-18 07:12 PM,like other classes suck and whatnot but the level of death isnt the same,
Tempelina#0898,21-Mar-18 07:12 PM,true,
Chafos#1781,21-Mar-18 07:12 PM,brit lit and physics c e & m are close 2nd and 3rds tho,
Tempelina#0898,21-Mar-18 07:12 PM,and if you don't even like bio.....I can't imagine,
8726andrew#5709,21-Mar-18 07:12 PM,e and m isnt that bad since they curve it a lot more,
Ｐｒｅｓｉｄｅｎｔ Ｓｋｅｅｔ#0513,21-Mar-18 07:13 PM,i heard it's still pretty bad,
Tempelina#0898,21-Mar-18 07:13 PM,I still didn't do that well lol,
Tempelina#0898,21-Mar-18 07:13 PM,Just because I was so ill prepared,
8726andrew#5709,21-Mar-18 07:13 PM,bad teacher?,
Tempelina#0898,21-Mar-18 07:13 PM,Yep,
8726andrew#5709,21-Mar-18 07:13 PM,rip,
8726andrew#5709,21-Mar-18 07:13 PM,my teacher doesnt suck so while the tests i was floundering i kinda did okay on them,
8726andrew#5709,21-Mar-18 07:13 PM,circuits are free tho,
Tempelina#0898,21-Mar-18 07:14 PM,"*walks into classroom* ""Um yeah write down everything you know about photosynthesis which we haven't learned about yet. Oh yeah and it's a quiz grade.""",
8726andrew#5709,21-Mar-18 07:14 PM,fun fun,
Rye#0666,21-Mar-18 07:14 PM,Circuits haaaa,
Rye#0666,21-Mar-18 07:14 PM,Not free for me,
Tempelina#0898,21-Mar-18 07:14 PM,My teacher now is strict af but really good,
8726andrew#5709,21-Mar-18 07:14 PM,rye is a meme,
8726andrew#5709,21-Mar-18 07:15 PM,did an entire frq wrong somehow,
Rye#0666,21-Mar-18 07:15 PM,Apparently I didn't understand how capacitors work,
Chafos#1781,21-Mar-18 07:15 PM,ughh don't get me started,
Rye#0666,21-Mar-18 07:15 PM,I legit have to review a bit for E&M,
Chafos#1781,21-Mar-18 07:15 PM,worst test grade of the year because of those stupid capacitors,
Tempelina#0898,21-Mar-18 07:15 PM,good luck haha,
Chafos#1781,21-Mar-18 07:15 PM,and circuits,
MEE6#4876,21-Mar-18 07:15 PM,"GG @Tempelina#0898, you just advanced to level 2!",
Rye#0666,21-Mar-18 07:15 PM,I feel fine on Mechanics though,
Chafos#1781,21-Mar-18 07:15 PM,mechanics was easy,
8726andrew#5709,21-Mar-18 07:16 PM,lol what,
8726andrew#5709,21-Mar-18 07:16 PM,electro statics and magnetism are way harder,
8726andrew#5709,21-Mar-18 07:16 PM,like its not even close,
Chafos#1781,21-Mar-18 07:17 PM,i just had my magnetism test.  it's gonna be one of my best of the year lol,
Chafos#1781,21-Mar-18 07:17 PM,idk if there's a harder part of magnetism though,
mic#7575,21-Mar-18 07:54 PM,wdym by free,
mic#7575,21-Mar-18 07:55 PM,lol I deadass got a 50 on my simple harmonic motion test,
mic#7575,21-Mar-18 07:56 PM,and a 69 on my forces quiz,
mic#7575,21-Mar-18 08:01 PM,I think the only reason I passed my gravity quiz is that all the questions on the tests are from old AP problems,
Raj#6135,21-Mar-18 08:03 PM,mechanics is easy for me,
Raj#6135,21-Mar-18 08:03 PM,i mean,
Raj#6135,21-Mar-18 08:03 PM,hard,
Raj#6135,21-Mar-18 08:03 PM,*,
Raj#6135,21-Mar-18 08:03 PM,i personally think e and m is easier,
Raj#6135,21-Mar-18 08:03 PM,i did so bad mechanics unit,
mic#7575,21-Mar-18 08:06 PM,anyone else here suffering through orgo,
mic#7575,21-Mar-18 08:06 PM,huh (@Raj),

waffle.dynasty#2740,21-Mar-18 08:09 PM,Kinda cool actually,
Ｐｒｅｓｉｄｅｎｔ Ｓｋｅｅｔ#0513,21-Mar-18 08:09 PM,^i feel the same way. Everything with e&m made sense (except Gauss's Law). Mechanics properly shafted me with dynamics,
Raj#6135,21-Mar-18 08:10 PM,like yeah me too^ mechanics actually hurt but E and M makes sooooo much sense,
Rye#0666,21-Mar-18 08:10 PM,I'm the opposite,

Caw#1913,21-Mar-18 08:11 PM,Mechanics is good,
Caw#1913,21-Mar-18 08:11 PM,E&M is where it gets hard,
Rye#0666,21-Mar-18 08:11 PM,Well that's why we're AE majors :SquidDab:,
Caw#1913,21-Mar-18 08:11 PM,Yep lol,
Rye#0666,21-Mar-18 08:11 PM,Although there's a class dedicated to circuits,
Caw#1913,21-Mar-18 08:11 PM,Although I want to focus on systems design so I might want to stick with it,
Rye#0666,21-Mar-18 08:11 PM,@8726andrew#5709 Help me,
Rye#0666,21-Mar-18 08:11 PM,Pls,
Caw#1913,21-Mar-18 08:11 PM,I'm fine with circuits actually,
Rye#0666,21-Mar-18 08:11 PM,I don't want to take a circuits class,
Rye#0666,21-Mar-18 08:11 PM,I'm so bad at circuits it's laughable,
Caw#1913,21-Mar-18 08:11 PM,It's the more general physics stuff with magnetism and electricity,
Rye#0666,21-Mar-18 08:12 PM,Disproportionately bad compared to everything else in physics,
Rye#0666,21-Mar-18 08:12 PM,Actually I think I did worse on magnetism,
Rye#0666,21-Mar-18 08:12 PM,But circuits is supposed to be easy but I struggle with it,
Caw#1913,21-Mar-18 08:12 PM,"Problem is though I haven't had an actual teacher for E&M yet, I've only taken online courses and self studied with it",

Rye#0666,21-Mar-18 08:15 PM,Yep,

Caw#1913,21-Mar-18 08:15 PM,Ryan you focused more on astronautical or aeronautical?,
Rye#0666,21-Mar-18 08:16 PM,Astro,
Caw#1913,21-Mar-18 08:16 PM,That's what I'm hoping to focus on too,
Caw#1913,21-Mar-18 08:18 PM,GATech has some awesome propulsion labs and other labs for the astronomical side of AE,

Tempelina#0898,22-Mar-18 07:19 PM,Well idk what I was expecting from undergrads to a technical institute lol,
thedragonlegacy#2854,22-Mar-18 07:21 PM,I do graphic design stuff,
thedragonlegacy#2854,22-Mar-18 07:21 PM,i cant art,
Chafos#1781,22-Mar-18 07:21 PM,I also can’t art,
Chafos#1781,22-Mar-18 07:22 PM,but I don’t do graphic design stuff,
Chafos#1781,22-Mar-18 07:22 PM,except basic Microsoft paint stuff 👌,
Tempelina#0898,22-Mar-18 07:22 PM,"I need art buddies, literally no one I know is an artist",
Lennox#3038,22-Mar-18 07:23 PM,I've been trying to learn over the past six months,
Tempelina#0898,22-Mar-18 07:23 PM,What medium have you started with?,
Lennox#3038,22-Mar-18 07:24 PM,"I've done photoshop stuff for years, but not actually drawing with it",
Lennox#3038,22-Mar-18 07:24 PM,I've started with just paper and pencil,
Lennox#3038,22-Mar-18 07:24 PM,taking online free classes,
Tempelina#0898,22-Mar-18 07:25 PM,"cool. I do mostly traditional too, and I think I started drawing around....freshmen year high school? That's when I began to actively learn how to draw",
Tempelina#0898,22-Mar-18 07:26 PM,I need to practice a lot more though haha,
Lennox#3038,22-Mar-18 07:26 PM,Have you heard of drawabox?,
Tempelina#0898,22-Mar-18 07:26 PM,no I haven't,
Lennox#3038,22-Mar-18 07:27 PM,That's what I'm doing right now,
Lennox#3038,22-Mar-18 07:27 PM,It's a website/class that focuses on technical drawing,
Lennox#3038,22-Mar-18 07:28 PM,The guy who runs it made a discord where he and other people review each other's lessons,
Tempelina#0898,22-Mar-18 07:28 PM,"Yeah I'm looking at it, it looks cool",
Tempelina#0898,22-Mar-18 07:29 PM,"I'm honestly too lazy to take classes haha, I just learn on my own by practicing (and a lot of failure)",
Lennox#3038,22-Mar-18 07:29 PM,"Hey, whatever works for you",
Tempelina#0898,22-Mar-18 07:30 PM,What kind of stuff are you focusing on drawing?,
Lennox#3038,22-Mar-18 07:31 PM,My late game plan is to be able to draw characters for dnd,
Lennox#3038,22-Mar-18 07:31 PM,But now I'm just trying to get down the very basics,
Tempelina#0898,22-Mar-18 07:31 PM,OH my lord,
Lennox#3038,22-Mar-18 07:31 PM,What about you?,
Tempelina#0898,22-Mar-18 07:31 PM,"I have someone who is both in this discord and would probably love to talk to you, when you do eventually learn",
Tempelina#0898,22-Mar-18 07:32 PM,He's a DM and is really enthusiastic about dnd,
Lennox#3038,22-Mar-18 07:33 PM,Who is it?,
Lennox#3038,22-Mar-18 07:33 PM,If I may ask,
Tempelina#0898,22-Mar-18 07:33 PM,Jake A,
Lennox#3038,22-Mar-18 07:33 PM,Lol I'm already playing a dnd game with him,
Lennox#3038,22-Mar-18 07:33 PM,He's great,
Tempelina#0898,22-Mar-18 07:34 PM,He's my best friend haha,
Tempelina#0898,22-Mar-18 07:34 PM,"And we both got into Tech, really lucky",
thedragonlegacy#2854,22-Mar-18 07:34 PM,ohmg nice ! haha,
thedragonlegacy#2854,22-Mar-18 07:34 PM,(im in a game with him too),
thedragonlegacy#2854,22-Mar-18 07:35 PM,(with lennox),
Tempelina#0898,22-Mar-18 07:35 PM,Yeah it's really awesome. I'm going to be in one of his frostfell campaigns next fall,
Tempelina#0898,22-Mar-18 07:35 PM,So if you guys are still in his campaigns we can all play together 👍,
Lennox#3038,22-Mar-18 07:36 PM,Looking forward to it  :),
Tempelina#0898,22-Mar-18 07:37 PM,Niiice. I am half-competent at character design so I might draw up the character I make but I'm shit at humans so we'll see,
Tempelina#0898,22-Mar-18 07:37 PM,I can only seem to draw birds at the moment 🤔,
Lennox#3038,22-Mar-18 07:38 PM,What flavor of bird?,
Tempelina#0898,22-Mar-18 07:38 PM,Spicy with just a hint of rosemary,
waffle.dynasty#2740,22-Mar-18 07:39 PM,I'm into 3d art tbh,
Chafos#1781,22-Mar-18 07:39 PM,how does one draw a bird that tastes like rosemary,
Lennox#3038,22-Mar-18 07:39 PM,very carefully,
Tempelina#0898,22-Mar-18 07:39 PM,It's a secret shhhh,
Chafos#1781,22-Mar-18 07:40 PM,fair enough,
Yeee#1012,23-Mar-18 04:47 AM,anyone gotten their acceptance packets yet,
Yeee#1012,23-Mar-18 04:48 AM,im in taiwan btw,
joazlazer#2041,23-Mar-18 09:38 AM,"I got a ""packet"" but it was just a small cardstock letter of acceptance telling me to go online",
joazlazer#2041,23-Mar-18 09:40 AM,also national merit scholarships came out but georgia tech stopped offering college-sponsored scholarships a few years ago :FeelsBadMan: :haHAA:,
joazlazer#2041,23-Mar-18 09:50 AM,2500 is nice tho to defray the permanent medical costs imposed by living with only one kidney (tech has my other one),

thedragonlegacy#2854,23-Mar-18 11:53 AM,I spent a WHOLE semester learning about magnetism to find out that relativity is the basis of current-induced magnetism,
thedragonlegacy#2854,23-Mar-18 11:53 AM,shook,
8726andrew#5709,23-Mar-18 11:53 AM,Fun fun,
kk4jrq#5652,23-Mar-18 03:04 PM,When you learn stuff just so you can learn other stuff to tell you all that stuff you learned is wrong but you had to learn that stuff to learn this stuff to understand it all and understand why it is wrong.,
Cole#0059,23-Mar-18 03:11 PM,somethin with physics? ^,
Ｐｒｅｓｉｄｅｎｔ Ｓｋｅｅｔ#0513,23-Mar-18 03:20 PM,I didn't need this @thedragonlegacy#2854 I just started learning magnetism,

Thedarkbobman#8576,24-Mar-18 08:24 PM,what is conditional,
thedragonlegacy#2854,24-Mar-18 08:27 PM,"i think conditional is ""you can come after 1 year""",
8726andrew#5709,24-Mar-18 08:36 PM,It’s a guaranteed transfer if you meet certain requirements I think,
8726andrew#5709,24-Mar-18 08:36 PM,Like maintain x gpa or something idk for sure tho,
thedragonlegacy#2854,24-Mar-18 08:37 PM,it probably depends on what gt offers,
Ｐｒｅｓｉｄｅｎｔ Ｓｋｅｅｔ#0513,24-Mar-18 08:50 PM,yea,
Ｐｒｅｓｉｄｅｎｔ Ｓｋｅｅｔ#0513,24-Mar-18 08:51 PM,most of th epeople ik at my school got conditional,
Ｐｒｅｓｉｄｅｎｔ Ｓｋｅｅｔ#0513,24-Mar-18 08:51 PM,"For Engineering and CS, youhave to get 30 credit hours and  maintain a 3.3 gpa and they can trasnfer in",
Ｐｒｅｓｉｄｅｎｔ Ｓｋｅｅｔ#0513,24-Mar-18 08:52 PM,"for Arts and Sciences, you only need a 3.0",
Jake A#0940,24-Mar-18 08:57 PM,"I have an exceptionally random question that I can't find an answer to with Google so let's see what you guys have for me., , In the poles like Antarctica, there's really only two seasons, summer and winter, where they have 24 hour days and 24 hour nights respectively. Does that mean that the tidal forces on the waves near the poles is really small during the summer because there's no night time, and then oppositely are there also really massive waves during the winter with the 24 hour nights?",
Lennox#3038,24-Mar-18 09:02 PM,Tides come in from warmer areas,
Lennox#3038,24-Mar-18 09:02 PM,"The largest component of the tide in the Arctic Ocean is, the semidiurnal M2 (period 12.42h). Since the tide, producing force for this constituent in the Arctic Ocean is, very small, the origin of this wave is an incoming tide, from the Atlantic Ocean. The M2 tide entering the Arctic, Ocean between Greenland and Scandinavia is divided by, Spitsbergen into two branches. The main wave enters through, the Greenland Sea and the secondary wave propagates around, Scandinavia towards the White Sea. The latter has, amplitude at Northern Norway of about 1m. In the White Sea, at the entrance it grows to about 2-3m and in the shallow, Mezen Bay the amplitude is greater than 4m.",
Lennox#3038,24-Mar-18 09:02 PM,http://www.uaf.edu/cfos/research/institute-of-marine-scien/zygmunt-kowalik-publicati/Kowalik-Tides.pdf,
Lennox#3038,24-Mar-18 09:02 PM,for more info,
Lennox#3038,24-Mar-18 09:03 PM,So I guess the tides are still somewhat normalized,
Jake A#0940,24-Mar-18 09:04 PM,"Jesus Lennox, thanks for the thesis for my question XD",
jakchoy#8192,24-Mar-18 09:33 PM,anyone going to the acceptamce tours on the 27th?,

Snowfish#4289,24-Mar-18 10:13 PM,i thought tides were mostly a moon thing 🤔,
jakchoy#8192,24-Mar-18 10:51 PM,@angrymunch739#7866 http://admission.gatech.edu/visit/admitted-freshman,
jakchoy#8192,25-Mar-18 01:30 AM,tides are mostly a moon thing tho,
Lennox#3038,25-Mar-18 01:37 AM,"The semidiurnal (high and low tides each lunar day)  tide-producing potential vanishes at the Pole and obtains only small values in the whole Polar Basin, for which reason the tides originating in the Arctic Sea will be small and almost negligible.",
Lennox#3038,25-Mar-18 01:37 AM,weird,
Lennox#3038,25-Mar-18 01:38 AM,I feel like the moon should impact the poles more than it does,
Arya201#6452,25-Mar-18 09:27 AM,can someone explain me op-amp?,

kk4jrq#5652,25-Mar-18 10:33 AM,It's a device that amplifies voltage,
kk4jrq#5652,25-Mar-18 10:33 AM,That's the simplest explanation,
Arya201#6452,25-Mar-18 10:39 AM,But..,

Chafos#1781,25-Mar-18 05:18 PM,I know there’s a course that all freshmen have to take that teaches various skills like that,

Chafos#1781,26-Mar-18 06:54 PM,Maybe if I get really desperate I’ll make a trivia AI to look up the question answers for me XD,
Lordbobby104#0879,26-Mar-18 06:59 PM,I've thought about that too,
Lordbobby104#0879,26-Mar-18 06:59 PM,"I mean once it knows the question and possible answers, it wouldn't be difficult to find the correct answer most of the time",
kk4jrq#5652,26-Mar-18 07:05 PM,Yeah... Just get it on fast internet and it should be in the first article that comes up,
kk4jrq#5652,26-Mar-18 07:06 PM,just do a frequency for words kind of deal and pick based off of that,
Chafos#1781,26-Mar-18 07:22 PM,I was all good until you said fast internet 😦,

Chafos#1781,26-Mar-18 10:03 PM,their body mass looks more like that of a gopher to me,
Chafos#1781,26-Mar-18 10:03 PM,at least in the first pic,
Chafos#1781,26-Mar-18 10:03 PM,and then the head is just abnormally small,
thedragonlegacy#2854,26-Mar-18 10:04 PM,they look like,
thedragonlegacy#2854,26-Mar-18 10:04 PM,what i feel after i eat a big meal,
thedragonlegacy#2854,26-Mar-18 10:05 PM,i wonder what sounds they make,
Chafos#1781,26-Mar-18 10:06 PM,oh they're hella annoying it seems like,
Chafos#1781,26-Mar-18 10:06 PM,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=498lYih-ycw,
Chafos#1781,26-Mar-18 10:07 PM,almost like a seagull but if someone had a car alarm and replaced the sound with a seagull audio file,
thedragonlegacy#2854,26-Mar-18 10:07 PM,:haHAA:,
thedragonlegacy#2854,26-Mar-18 10:08 PM,"maybe if i had one, i'd actually wake up on time in the morning",
Chafos#1781,26-Mar-18 10:08 PM,haha true,
Chafos#1781,26-Mar-18 10:09 PM,it would be nice if I actually woke up on time so I didn't have to go 90 to get to school on time XD,
thedragonlegacy#2854,26-Mar-18 10:10 PM,i've managed to have 1 late thingy on my record.,
thedragonlegacy#2854,26-Mar-18 10:10 PM,ugh what are they called,
thedragonlegacy#2854,26-Mar-18 10:10 PM,where the school ticks the amount of times you're late to school,
Lennox#3038,26-Mar-18 10:10 PM,tardy?,
thedragonlegacy#2854,26-Mar-18 10:10 PM,yeah....,
thedragonlegacy#2854,26-Mar-18 10:11 PM,"i've had only 1 tardy even tho i've been late many more times 😂 ah, the joys of driving to school",
Rye#0666,26-Mar-18 10:15 PM,I haven't been tardy once this year,
Rye#0666,26-Mar-18 10:15 PM,I was twice in sophomore year,
Rye#0666,26-Mar-18 10:15 PM,One was because I was working on an AP Chem test and had to walk all the way across the school,
Rye#0666,26-Mar-18 10:15 PM,Probably should've asked for a pass,
Rye#0666,26-Mar-18 10:15 PM,Second time was because I couldn't sleep the night before school so I slept in,
8726andrew#5709,26-Mar-18 10:16 PM,i was one time sophomore year bc i got to class right before the bell and i forgot about the class being in a lab,
Rye#0666,26-Mar-18 10:16 PM,And then junior year I was technically late but Ames didn't care :SquidDab:,
8726andrew#5709,26-Mar-18 10:16 PM,smh,
arechawla#3188,26-Mar-18 10:16 PM,Lol,
arechawla#3188,26-Mar-18 10:17 PM,Im tardy like literally 4/5 times in the week but my teacher is chill so she only recorded like two times,
mic#7575,26-Mar-18 10:17 PM,I take public transportation so I get like five+ tardies a semester,
mic#7575,26-Mar-18 10:18 PM,"although tbh it’s because I get up to turn off my alarm, wash my face, and then go straight back to bed",
thedragonlegacy#2854,26-Mar-18 10:18 PM,i just snooze my alarm too much,
thedragonlegacy#2854,26-Mar-18 10:19 PM,that i dont even remember waking up and snoozing my phone anymore,
Lennox#3038,26-Mar-18 10:19 PM,I always try to get out of bed as soon as possible,
thedragonlegacy#2854,26-Mar-18 10:19 PM,"as a result, i have made great efforts in choosing annoying AF alarm tones",
Lennox#3038,26-Mar-18 10:19 PM,so I have time to get back in it later,
8726andrew#5709,26-Mar-18 10:30 PM,my watch vibrates on my wrist as my alarm,
8726andrew#5709,26-Mar-18 10:30 PM,ive started sleeping through it fml,
8726andrew#5709,26-Mar-18 10:30 PM,i have to resort to changing when my alarm goes off,
Mocha#8744,26-Mar-18 10:47 PM,I have a watch alarm that goes off at 12:00 AM every night,
Mocha#8744,26-Mar-18 10:47 PM,I don't know how to change it,
Mocha#8744,26-Mar-18 10:47 PM,So it's been like this for years,
Tempelina#0898,27-Mar-18 06:43 AM,If I don’t set like 5 alarms I will NOT wake up,
Tempelina#0898,27-Mar-18 06:44 AM,"I find that having a set schedule can help. Like my first alarm goes off at 6:35, then every five mins until I have to turn my light on at 6:50, then I have to get up by 7:00",
mic#7575,27-Mar-18 09:44 AM,If I have multiple alarms I think I’m gonna get up so I turn them all off and then go back to sleep,
Rye#0666,27-Mar-18 11:42 AM,Same,
thedragonlegacy#2854,27-Mar-18 03:22 PM,-_- I had a moment just now,
kk4jrq#5652,27-Mar-18 03:41 PM,A moment?,
thedragonlegacy#2854,27-Mar-18 03:45 PM,i needed to add more steering fluid into my car since it's leaking,
thedragonlegacy#2854,27-Mar-18 03:46 PM,"popped the hood open, took out the cap to the steering fluid pump/cylinder",
thedragonlegacy#2854,27-Mar-18 03:46 PM,thought i placed it on top of the engine,
thedragonlegacy#2854,27-Mar-18 03:47 PM,proceeded to close the hood and heard something small fall somewhere,
thedragonlegacy#2854,27-Mar-18 03:47 PM,remembered that i didn't put the cap back on,
thedragonlegacy#2854,27-Mar-18 03:48 PM,"so i'm searching and searching, under the car, in the wires around the engine, groaning in despair",
thedragonlegacy#2854,27-Mar-18 03:48 PM,this continues for like 10 minutes,
thedragonlegacy#2854,27-Mar-18 03:49 PM,then i decided to step back and frustratingly huff in more despair,
thedragonlegacy#2854,27-Mar-18 03:49 PM,and i spot the cap nested on the shelf of a garage cabinet,
thedragonlegacy#2854,27-Mar-18 03:50 PM,*it was on the stupid shelf!!! wtffffff*,
thedragonlegacy#2854,27-Mar-18 03:50 PM,-__- so yeah that was quite a moment,

MEE6#4876,28-Mar-18 12:06 PM,"GG @venom/Dean#0512, you just advanced to level 2!",
mic#7575,28-Mar-18 12:33 PM,I get emails from Cappex but it looks like so many of these are just for people who go to a specific program or live in a certain place,
mic#7575,28-Mar-18 12:33 PM,Also I’m kind of lazy because it sounds competitive,
mic#7575,28-Mar-18 12:34 PM,Did you manage to nab some scholarships?,
venom/Dean#0512,28-Mar-18 12:37 PM,"From georgia tech specifically, no",

shortgiraffes#1231,30-Mar-18 02:55 PM,so does GT just like not meet need aid or do they only do loans?,
shortgiraffes#1231,30-Mar-18 02:56 PM,"bc i have a need number listed but then everything below is a loan, not even work study",
shortgiraffes#1231,30-Mar-18 02:56 PM,and theres no way my family is gonna be cool with paying like 50k a year for tech in loans and such. Does anyone know if this letter include CSS award?,
venom/Dean#0512,30-Mar-18 02:57 PM,My only included grants,

kk4jrq#5652,30-Mar-18 03:23 PM,University aid,
mic#7575,30-Mar-18 03:34 PM,I got aid that wasn't just loans,
8726andrew#5709,30-Mar-18 03:35 PM,April first is sunday lmao,
8726andrew#5709,30-Mar-18 03:36 PM,Also I’m pretty sure I got fucked over bc my dad got laid off at the end of last year and got his severance as a lump sum so his income looks like he just randomly made a ton of extra money even though he was out of work for like 3 months this year,
mic#7575,30-Mar-18 03:36 PM,Yikes,
venom/Dean#0512,30-Mar-18 03:37 PM,Why does it have to be so expensive,
kk4jrq#5652,30-Mar-18 03:38 PM,Cuz they can...,
kk4jrq#5652,30-Mar-18 03:38 PM,It's expected for you to go to college so they can charge whatever they want,
kk4jrq#5652,30-Mar-18 03:39 PM,And everyone is inflating prices so there is nothing to compare it to,
venom/Dean#0512,30-Mar-18 03:39 PM,Where's bernie sanders when you need him,
kk4jrq#5652,30-Mar-18 03:39 PM,Yeah but all that'll do is increase taxes to pay for it...,
venom/Dean#0512,30-Mar-18 03:39 PM,Yeah...,
kk4jrq#5652,30-Mar-18 03:40 PM,What we really need is someone to hold these schools accountable to reasonable prices,
kk4jrq#5652,30-Mar-18 03:40 PM,Just like we do with business... We don't let them charge insane prices or monopolize stuff,
coopm26#7386,30-Mar-18 03:40 PM,Supply and demand,
kk4jrq#5652,30-Mar-18 03:40 PM,True,
kk4jrq#5652,30-Mar-18 03:41 PM,Demand is high.  Supply is low,
kk4jrq#5652,30-Mar-18 03:41 PM,Costs are insane,
Le Noir DragooN#8434,30-Mar-18 03:41 PM,These days all colleges except for in-state flagships come with high sticker prices,

Le Noir DragooN#8434,30-Mar-18 04:04 PM,Is the 50k oos pricetag worth it in the long run,
Le Noir DragooN#8434,30-Mar-18 04:04 PM,I know the opportunities at Tech are excellent,
venom/Dean#0512,30-Mar-18 04:05 PM,20k is more reasonable but 50k? heck no. That's 200k-250k for your bachelor,
mic#7575,30-Mar-18 04:21 PM,Apparently rising costs are also because the government just wants to subsidize colleges less,
MEE6#4876,30-Mar-18 04:21 PM,"GG @mic#7575, you just advanced to level 7!",
venom/Dean#0512,30-Mar-18 04:23 PM,Ridiculous,
mic#7575,30-Mar-18 04:28 PM,and also apparently the existence of government-secured loans?,
mic#7575,30-Mar-18 04:28 PM,can't rly tell what factors are most important tho,
Raj#6135,30-Mar-18 05:49 PM,Idea: new role: OOS No Aid Rejects,
venom/Dean#0512,30-Mar-18 05:51 PM,😂😂,
angrymunch739#7866,30-Mar-18 09:37 PM,So is the award letter we received what we can possibly get for financial aid?,
kk4jrq#5652,30-Mar-18 09:57 PM,It is what you get,
joazlazer#2041,30-Mar-18 10:01 PM,"so it says outside scholarships will reduce the amount, but for me CoA - (EFC + institutional scholarships) >> 0. will they still reduce the award amount for something like the $2500 NMSC scholarship?",
venom/Dean#0512,30-Mar-18 10:02 PM,You'd have to email the contact in the award letter to have them change it,
venom/Dean#0512,30-Mar-18 10:03 PM,They'd add thst scholarship to the letter for an updated amount,
MEE6#4876,30-Mar-18 10:03 PM,"GG @venom/Dean#0512, you just advanced to level 4!",
mic#7575,30-Mar-18 10:37 PM,Oh right National Merit is a thing that exists,
venom/Dean#0512,30-Mar-18 10:38 PM,😂,
mic#7575,30-Mar-18 10:38 PM,Wait so should I email them about NMSC or will they automatically know to take that into account,
venom/Dean#0512,30-Mar-18 10:39 PM,They probably won't know about it,
mic#7575,30-Mar-18 10:39 PM,Oh okay,
mic#7575,30-Mar-18 10:41 PM,@Joseph I think it's supposed to be that CoA - (EFC + school scholarships + *loans*) ≈ 0,
mic#7575,30-Mar-18 10:44 PM,which kinda makes me wish the federal government didn't offer loans at all,
venom/Dean#0512,30-Mar-18 10:44 PM,Yeah....,
joazlazer#2041,30-Mar-18 11:16 PM,so hopefully outside scholarships just mean I'll have to take out less in loans? hoping that's the case bc if its not thats fucked up,
venom/Dean#0512,30-Mar-18 11:16 PM,It includes any scholarships or loans the school itself didn't offer,
venom/Dean#0512,30-Mar-18 11:17 PM,Which means you need less loans the more scholarships you get,
KyotoKoto#5113,30-Mar-18 11:55 PM,"got zell which i already expected, but didn't get anything from gt",

Sumedh_G#6616,31-Mar-18 09:32 PM,im sorry your season had to end that way,
kk4jrq#5652,31-Mar-18 09:32 PM,One time our autonomous flipped the motors for no reason and burned out our drive train,
Sumedh_G#6616,31-Mar-18 09:32 PM,you might have seen how our auto freaking crashed into 6750 cuz we had the 2017 wheel dimensions in ripppp,
Sumedh_G#6616,31-Mar-18 09:32 PM,then we had a reliable switch auto until playoffs,
Sumedh_G#6616,31-Mar-18 09:33 PM,thats how we could be 5th with a 7-5 record,
thedragonlegacy#2854,31-Mar-18 09:33 PM,quite the trip xD it was funny. we thought it was going to shoot it over the wall,
thedragonlegacy#2854,31-Mar-18 09:34 PM,who knows what penalty we would've gotten if it did,
Sumedh_G#6616,31-Mar-18 09:34 PM,"actually i did the math, and if we had won 2 more matches or won 1 and gotten one more auto quest, we wouldve been tied with 1102 and 6829 for 1st lmao",

Sumedh_G#6616,31-Mar-18 09:34 PM,yeahhhhh,
thedragonlegacy#2854,31-Mar-18 09:34 PM,but it was miscommunication problems with the FIRSt ppl,

Caw#1913,01-Apr-18 01:08 AM,And it actually made the game community better,
Caw#1913,01-Apr-18 01:08 AM,A lot less people who only cared about the skins,
Caw#1913,01-Apr-18 01:09 AM,Im pretty sure the government just couldn't be bothered to do anything,
Caw#1913,01-Apr-18 01:09 AM,"I think Valve realized that if the government ever decided to actually do something, it would be their ass",
Lennox#3038,01-Apr-18 01:09 AM,It really was a ticking bomb,
Caw#1913,01-Apr-18 01:10 AM,It seemed like every major youtuber had their own gambling site,
Caw#1913,01-Apr-18 01:10 AM,And a lot of them were just straight scams under the guise of a fair website,
Lennox#3038,01-Apr-18 01:11 AM,But exposing them didn't even touch the youtuber's popularity,
Lennox#3038,01-Apr-18 01:11 AM,which is what it is,
Lennox#3038,01-Apr-18 01:11 AM,Did the sites themselves go down after that?,
Caw#1913,01-Apr-18 01:12 AM,wdym?,
Lennox#3038,01-Apr-18 01:12 AM,like the sites the youtubers endorsed,
Caw#1913,01-Apr-18 01:12 AM,Oh did they get taken down the C&D?,
Caw#1913,01-Apr-18 01:12 AM,Because I'm pretty sure most of them did,
Lennox#3038,01-Apr-18 01:13 AM,"After that, yeah",
Caw#1913,01-Apr-18 01:14 AM,"I know a lot of what Valve did was just end the gambling with skins, not entirely sure about gambling with just straight money",
Caw#1913,01-Apr-18 01:14 AM,Like most legit sports websites do,
Lennox#3038,01-Apr-18 01:15 AM,I'm sure those still exist,
Lennox#3038,01-Apr-18 01:15 AM,but skins made it so much more accessible,
Caw#1913,01-Apr-18 01:15 AM,There was one time I was stupid and found this one roulette side and I thought I cracked the code,
Caw#1913,01-Apr-18 01:16 AM,I sucked at statistics and thought that betting black,
Caw#1913,01-Apr-18 01:16 AM,like 100%,
Caw#1913,01-Apr-18 01:16 AM,would equal a payout >50%,
Caw#1913,01-Apr-18 01:16 AM,I left it running overnight with like the free dollar you got from the website,
Caw#1913,01-Apr-18 01:16 AM,Woke up to 0 -.-,
Lennox#3038,01-Apr-18 01:16 AM,rip,
Caw#1913,01-Apr-18 01:17 AM,Yah learned a lesson in stats that night,
Lennox#3038,01-Apr-18 01:17 AM,I've lost a fair amount of money in online markets,
Lennox#3038,01-Apr-18 01:17 AM,"well, not really lost b/c I started with $0",
Caw#1913,01-Apr-18 01:17 AM,Like crypto?,
Lennox#3038,01-Apr-18 01:17 AM,"No, items",
Lennox#3038,01-Apr-18 01:18 AM,I was into TF2 trading in middle school,
Lennox#3038,01-Apr-18 01:18 AM,racked up like $140?,
Caw#1913,01-Apr-18 01:18 AM,Oh damn,
Caw#1913,01-Apr-18 01:18 AM,"If you want a sad story, my friend had traded up 20$ in CS:GO to like 150 or something with a knife. He got VAC banned",
Lennox#3038,01-Apr-18 01:18 AM,aww,
Lennox#3038,01-Apr-18 01:19 AM,but really you shouldn't cheat with an inventory :s,
Lennox#3038,01-Apr-18 01:19 AM,or at all,
Caw#1913,01-Apr-18 01:19 AM,Yah well what he normally did was trade it away,
Caw#1913,01-Apr-18 01:19 AM,But he hadn't hacked in like a week,
Caw#1913,01-Apr-18 01:19 AM,So he was convinced he was fine,
Caw#1913,01-Apr-18 01:19 AM,I tried warning him,
Caw#1913,01-Apr-18 01:19 AM,"Lemme see if I can find his profile, I think he has it on display",
Lennox#3038,01-Apr-18 01:20 AM,I lost most of my monies after a central currency in the TF2 economy crashed,
Caw#1913,01-Apr-18 01:20 AM,Ah yes,
MEE6#4876,01-Apr-18 01:20 AM,"GG @Caw#1913, you just advanced to level 4!",
Lennox#3038,01-Apr-18 01:21 AM,rip earbuds $40 --> $5,
Caw#1913,01-Apr-18 01:21 AM,The tf2 crash of 2014,
Caw#1913,01-Apr-18 01:21 AM,Level 4,
Caw#1913,01-Apr-18 01:21 AM,I have never been so proud in my entire life,
Caw#1913,01-Apr-18 01:21 AM,My GATech acceptance holds nothing to this,
Caw#1913,01-Apr-18 01:22 AM,Also here's my friends profile http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198114101989/,
Caw#1913,01-Apr-18 01:22 AM,With the banned items,

efank#9753,05-Apr-18 11:26 AM,ah yeee,
efank#9753,05-Apr-18 11:26 AM,is it hard to?,
efank#9753,05-Apr-18 11:27 AM,switch to CS? tbh cause I still kinda want to do math anyways,
Le Noir DragooN#8434,05-Apr-18 11:27 AM,From what i’ve heard no,
Le Noir DragooN#8434,05-Apr-18 11:27 AM,Or i may just switch to math...,
efank#9753,05-Apr-18 11:27 AM,ah did you give up on physics lol,
Le Noir DragooN#8434,05-Apr-18 11:27 AM,"I still love physics, but i feel math and cs would be more fun",
efank#9753,05-Apr-18 11:28 AM,hmm,
efank#9753,05-Apr-18 11:28 AM,i kinda like all 3 i guess?,
Le Noir DragooN#8434,05-Apr-18 11:28 AM,"Big problem, can’t triple major",
efank#9753,05-Apr-18 11:28 AM,"but i've done the most math, then secondly cs (just goofing around in linux), physics",
efank#9753,05-Apr-18 11:28 AM,lol,
Le Noir DragooN#8434,05-Apr-18 11:28 AM,Maybe double major,
Le Noir DragooN#8434,05-Apr-18 11:28 AM,🤔,
efank#9753,05-Apr-18 11:28 AM,oh wait,
efank#9753,05-Apr-18 11:28 AM,but then if it's easy to change,
efank#9753,05-Apr-18 11:28 AM,why does tech bother admitting by major?,
Le Noir DragooN#8434,05-Apr-18 11:29 AM,They don’t,
efank#9753,05-Apr-18 11:29 AM,oh they don't?,
Le Noir DragooN#8434,05-Apr-18 11:29 AM,You list a major but they allow you to switch,
Le Noir DragooN#8434,05-Apr-18 11:29 AM,Hold pn,
Le Noir DragooN#8434,05-Apr-18 11:29 AM,*on,
Le Noir DragooN#8434,05-Apr-18 11:31 AM,They officially say they don’t but in reality they def do,
Le Noir DragooN#8434,05-Apr-18 11:31 AM,Take major into account that is,
efank#9753,05-Apr-18 11:36 AM,yea,
efank#9753,05-Apr-18 11:36 AM,so it probably isn't that easy to switch,
Le Noir DragooN#8434,05-Apr-18 11:37 AM,All you have to do is be in your major for the first semester and then you can switch. They acknowledge that 40% or so of the students plan to switch,
MEE6#4876,05-Apr-18 11:37 AM,"GG @Le Noir DragooN#8434, you just advanced to level 4!",
efank#9753,05-Apr-18 11:37 AM,"like I guess blatantly speaking, applying as math probably helped me out",
Arya201#6452,05-Apr-18 11:38 AM,hey y'all,
efank#9753,05-Apr-18 11:38 AM,bye y'all,
efank#9753,05-Apr-18 11:38 AM,just kiddin ye?,
Arya201#6452,05-Apr-18 11:38 AM,lol,
Arya201#6452,05-Apr-18 11:38 AM,whats up,
Le Noir DragooN#8434,05-Apr-18 11:39 AM,@Snowfish#4289 enlightened me on the route to change majors and the ease in doing so provides your academic standing is good,
Le Noir DragooN#8434,05-Apr-18 11:39 AM,*provided,
efank#9753,05-Apr-18 11:43 AM,then why even bother,
efank#9753,05-Apr-18 11:43 AM,asking for your major?,
efank#9753,05-Apr-18 11:44 AM,well I guess it is just for internal statistics then,
8726andrew#5709,05-Apr-18 11:56 AM,i mean every college does,
8726andrew#5709,05-Apr-18 11:56 AM,its to get you started on the track you in theory want to pursue,
8726andrew#5709,05-Apr-18 11:56 AM,obv having taken 0 classes no one really knows for sure and lots of kids want to switch,
Le Noir DragooN#8434,05-Apr-18 12:10 PM,^this,
efank#9753,05-Apr-18 12:11 PM,@8726andrew#5709  but don't a lot of colleges let you go undecided,
8726andrew#5709,05-Apr-18 12:11 PM,you can apply anywhere undeclared,
8726andrew#5709,05-Apr-18 12:11 PM,shit i applied undeclared engineering lol,
8726andrew#5709,05-Apr-18 12:12 PM,but entirely undeclared is something you can go in as,
8726andrew#5709,05-Apr-18 12:12 PM,albeit its better to at least have some idea of what you wanna do,
efank#9753,05-Apr-18 12:14 PM,ah makes sense,
kk4jrq#5652,05-Apr-18 12:21 PM,@efank#9753 you can run visual studio code on it... which is decent but it ain't no visual studio,
efank#9753,05-Apr-18 12:21 PM,@kk4jrq#5652  ah whats the diff,
MEE6#4876,05-Apr-18 12:21 PM,"GG @efank#9753, you just advanced to level 5!",
efank#9753,05-Apr-18 12:22 PM,ahhhh meeseeks ur so annoying,
efank#9753,05-Apr-18 12:42 PM,"oh yeah, can we let MathBot into here?",
Rye#0666,05-Apr-18 04:38 PM,Calculus is free,
joazlazer#2041,05-Apr-18 05:16 PM,debugging on VS Code from my experience is 👎,
joazlazer#2041,05-Apr-18 05:16 PM,VS on the other hand gives a ton of info during debugging :lick:,
kk4jrq#5652,05-Apr-18 06:09 PM,VS Code is great for writing in languages that VS doesn't support.  I love it's Arduino plugin.  That's mainly what I use it for.,
kk4jrq#5652,05-Apr-18 06:09 PM,Anyone here use VIM? I use a plugin for it... It makes coding so much faster,
Ｐｒｅｓｉｄｅｎｔ Ｓｋｅｅｔ#0513,05-Apr-18 06:12 PM,I downloaded VIM the other day but never got the chance to configure it. How do you like it?,
joazlazer#2041,05-Apr-18 06:31 PM,it looks like it would speed up coding if you use home-row typing (which ik im supposed to but I've gotten pretty good at point-typing :haHAA:),
venom/Dean#0512,05-Apr-18 06:49 PM,Anyone wanna loan me 20k a year😂,

venom/Dean#0512,05-Apr-18 07:17 PM,😧 i hate being financially deficient,
thedragonlegacy#2854,05-Apr-18 07:50 PM,the American dream of being broke,
thedragonlegacy#2854,05-Apr-18 07:51 PM,inside and outside,
venom/Dean#0512,05-Apr-18 08:00 PM,Very true,
venom/Dean#0512,05-Apr-18 08:00 PM,I want to go to tech so bad but idk if i can afford it,

Le Noir DragooN#8434,05-Apr-18 08:22 PM,They didn’t give a penny,
venom/Dean#0512,05-Apr-18 08:23 PM,"Not really, a little under 25k",
venom/Dean#0512,05-Apr-18 08:23 PM,In total,
venom/Dean#0512,05-Apr-18 08:23 PM,Georgia gave 9950,
Le Noir DragooN#8434,05-Apr-18 08:24 PM,Is that financial need based aid or scholarship money,
Le Noir DragooN#8434,05-Apr-18 08:24 PM,Cuz all I got was a scholarship,
venom/Dean#0512,05-Apr-18 08:25 PM,Need based aid,
Le Noir DragooN#8434,05-Apr-18 08:25 PM,They didn’t give me any need based aid ;-;,
Grubchubgrub#4239,05-Apr-18 08:27 PM,they didnt give me merit or need baised,

8726andrew#5709,05-Apr-18 09:12 PM,just not during class,
thedragonlegacy#2854,05-Apr-18 09:12 PM,o hi there,

thedragonlegacy#2854,05-Apr-18 09:17 PM,you'll probably see a range of outfits. i wouldn't be surprised if pjs were a thing,
Ｐｒｅｓｉｄｅｎｔ Ｓｋｅｅｔ#0513,05-Apr-18 09:18 PM,that means I can wear my loincloth 😄,

efank#9753,05-Apr-18 09:34 PM,@kk4jrq#5652 vim is amazing,
efank#9753,05-Apr-18 09:34 PM,I love it so much,
kk4jrq#5652,05-Apr-18 09:34 PM,IKR!!!,
efank#9753,05-Apr-18 09:35 PM,I always wanted to try out emacs,
kk4jrq#5652,05-Apr-18 09:35 PM,It took me a while to really get used to it but now I sit down in front of other computers and just mash out vim commands lol,
efank#9753,05-Apr-18 09:35 PM,but I realize too much effort will be spent trying to emulate emacs,
kk4jrq#5652,05-Apr-18 09:35 PM,Emacs is no........,

kk4jrq#5652,05-Apr-18 09:39 PM,I use a VM for it,
kk4jrq#5652,05-Apr-18 09:39 PM,I usually run windows cuz I used Solidworks. and  Visual Studio a lot of the time,
kk4jrq#5652,05-Apr-18 09:40 PM,"I have a plug in that makes visual studio, VS code, and Android studio use all the VIM commands",
efank#9753,05-Apr-18 09:42 PM,ah nice,
efank#9753,05-Apr-18 09:42 PM,windows 10 is surprisingly not as bad as I thought it to be,
kk4jrq#5652,05-Apr-18 09:42 PM,I hated 8,
kk4jrq#5652,05-Apr-18 09:43 PM,10 is the best yet,
kk4jrq#5652,05-Apr-18 09:43 PM,Esepcially from a dev/deployment perspective.,

venom/Dean#0512,06-Apr-18 03:38 PM,What is SMaRT?,
Tempelina#0898,06-Apr-18 03:39 PM,It’s a maths and sciences LLC that has a lot of bonding and research opportunities,
venom/Dean#0512,06-Apr-18 03:39 PM,Aaaah,
Tempelina#0898,06-Apr-18 03:39 PM,And I want to be a researcher as my career so :p,
venom/Dean#0512,06-Apr-18 03:40 PM,Oh nice,

Rye#0666,06-Apr-18 06:17 PM,Was it part of the LLCs?,
8726andrew#5709,06-Apr-18 06:18 PM,yes,
8726andrew#5709,06-Apr-18 06:19 PM,from what i heard it wasn't really much better and was more work for no reason but who knows how accurate that is,
Rye#0666,06-Apr-18 06:19 PM,Oh so you had to apply separately?,
8726andrew#5709,06-Apr-18 06:19 PM,ik it was an llc,
Rye#0666,06-Apr-18 06:20 PM,Purdue was like that,
Rye#0666,06-Apr-18 06:20 PM,Meanwhile GSU is like here you're in the honors college now,
Cole#0059,06-Apr-18 06:39 PM,what is the LLC?,
sophagawea#4326,06-Apr-18 06:47 PM,"Is means you have to take 15 credits of honors classes. This includes health, GT 1000, common core classes, and interdisciplinary courses, so it’s not that much more work. My honors classes will be ENGL 1102- 3 cr, GT 1000- 1 cr, APPH 1050- 2cr, CHEM, PSYC 1101- 3 cr, CS 1301- 3 cr,  MATH 1553- 2 cr., and one other class I’ll choose for fun. Options are classes like “science fiction 101” etc.",
sophagawea#4326,06-Apr-18 06:48 PM,So it’s not that much more work. And it has lots of benefits,
8726andrew#5709,06-Apr-18 06:48 PM,i mean thats just what other people said so idk,
8726andrew#5709,06-Apr-18 06:48 PM,also on paper it might not sound like a lot but dont underestimate the classes,
sophagawea#4326,06-Apr-18 06:48 PM,"You get to move in 2 days before everyone else, you get to register for classes before everyone else, the dorm apparently always has food and it’s own study hall... ¯\_(ツ)_/¯",
sophagawea#4326,06-Apr-18 06:49 PM,"The classes are just smaller and so you learn more one on one, average of <20 students rather than 100+",
8726andrew#5709,06-Apr-18 06:50 PM,lol if its campus food the idk if thats a good thing tbh,
8726andrew#5709,06-Apr-18 06:50 PM,doesnt every dorm have a study room on every/every other floor or something,
Cole#0059,06-Apr-18 06:53 PM,"ya, every dorm has study rooms. but so like... whats the point? like are other people not allowed to take those classes? and is it more about well-rounding the student and liberal arts, or is the major more important?",
8726andrew#5709,06-Apr-18 06:53 PM,from my understanding you take a lot of the same classes as other people so its a closer knit community type thing or something idk,
8726andrew#5709,06-Apr-18 06:54 PM,personally not my style so i didnt apply,
Cole#0059,06-Apr-18 06:55 PM,I didn't even know about it. but from what I'm hearing... it just sounds like a group of students who'll get to know each other and work with each other a lot more. I don't really see the benefits besides maybe getting to register for classes earlier,
udishab#2211,06-Apr-18 07:21 PM,"i heard that despite the whole ""community feeling"" you also kinda feel isolated from everyone else so idk i feel like it has both its advantages and disadvantages",
Le Noir DragooN#8434,06-Apr-18 07:47 PM,i probably will not join an llc,
Le Noir DragooN#8434,06-Apr-18 07:50 PM,do employers and higher education institutions take them into account when evaluating undergrads?,
sophagawea#4326,06-Apr-18 07:58 PM,Idk you get a certificate and stamp on your diploma. Idk whether it’s worth it or not. Most people have said to do it at least freshman year for the benefits. If it sucks it’s not binding so I can always stop,
sophagawea#4326,06-Apr-18 07:58 PM,Oh and by food I meant snacks.,

Tempelina#0898,06-Apr-18 09:09 PM,One of the other benefits of the SMaRT LLC that I know is that you get sort of a tasting platter of all of the research going on at Tech and you get more opportunities to do undergrad research. You also have “renowned researchers(?)” visit and talk to you and there are bonding trips like going to the zoo or a baseball game,
Tempelina#0898,06-Apr-18 09:10 PM,So that’s part of the difference from just doing regular FE,
Tempelina#0898,06-Apr-18 09:11 PM,But it’s DEFINITELY not for everyone haha. Just is really specific to what I like,
Chafos#1781,06-Apr-18 09:15 PM,I got into SMaRT but idk if I should do it because it’ll be mostly non CS people so big rip if I want to room near/with other CS majors,
MEE6#4876,06-Apr-18 09:15 PM,"GG @Chafos#1781, you just advanced to level 13!",
Chafos#1781,06-Apr-18 09:15 PM,But I also like math and science a lot so idk,
Tempelina#0898,06-Apr-18 09:16 PM,You can ask around to see what other CS majors are gonna be in it,
Tempelina#0898,06-Apr-18 09:16 PM,And depending on what you find make a decision,
Chafos#1781,06-Apr-18 09:17 PM,Oh yeah true I could literally just ask in the CS chats lmao,
Chafos#1781,06-Apr-18 09:17 PM,I’m going on like 3 hours of sleep so not thinking certain things through lol,
Tempelina#0898,06-Apr-18 09:17 PM,You should probably do something about that xD,
Rye#0666,06-Apr-18 09:18 PM,I don't think certain things through even with 8 hours of sleep :XD:,
Tempelina#0898,06-Apr-18 09:18 PM,I get 9 hours of sleep a night and I still feel like shit so maybe sleep is just an illusion,
Chafos#1781,06-Apr-18 09:19 PM,I’m on a trip overseas in Spain and literally everyone has been staying up so my sleep’s been hella whack recently,
Chafos#1781,06-Apr-18 09:19 PM,It’s 2:19 AM for me rn,
Tempelina#0898,06-Apr-18 09:19 PM,Yo when I went to Barcelona I had to wake up at 3 am to catch the plane home,
Chafos#1781,06-Apr-18 09:20 PM,Yup we have to get up at 4 AM in 2 days,
Tempelina#0898,06-Apr-18 09:20 PM,Is it just me or does their tap water taste absolutely horrible,
Chafos#1781,06-Apr-18 09:21 PM,Yeah it’s bad but not the worst.  When I backpacked at a scout camp in New Mexico we had to filter water from a stream with iodine tablets and that was far worse,
Tempelina#0898,06-Apr-18 09:22 PM,"Yeah, the outside and I don’t really mix that well",
Tempelina#0898,06-Apr-18 09:22 PM,How ironic that I’m at the beach rn T_T,
Chafos#1781,06-Apr-18 09:22 PM,I have hella allergies so I wouldn’t even say they do for me lol,
thedragonlegacy#2854,06-Apr-18 09:25 PM,are you having fun tho? seeing awesome sights?,
Chafos#1781,06-Apr-18 09:26 PM,Oh yeah!  It’s been a super cool trip,
Tempelina#0898,06-Apr-18 09:27 PM,Where are you in Spain?,
Chafos#1781,06-Apr-18 09:27 PM,We went and saw this one place called the Mesquita which was originally this super neat mosque that the Christians later took over and added in their own artwork with successive expansions while keeping the original building intact,
Chafos#1781,06-Apr-18 09:28 PM,"We stayed for 2 days in Madrid, then went to Toledo, Córdoba, Granada, and Sevilla (one day each except 2 in Sevilla).  And we’re in Lisbon, Portugal for the last 2 days but haven’t done anything here yet except go to the hotel",

Tempelina#0898,06-Apr-18 09:30 PM,Rosemary/seaside. Where everyone from Atlanta goes for spring break,
Rye#0666,06-Apr-18 09:31 PM,I like Rosemary,
Rye#0666,06-Apr-18 09:31 PM,Seaside is too basic,
Tempelina#0898,06-Apr-18 09:31 PM,"It’s literally my whole childhood, I know it better than where I live lollll",
Rye#0666,06-Apr-18 09:31 PM,I've been to Rosemary like three times,
Rye#0666,06-Apr-18 09:32 PM,"2011, 2012, and 2013 I think",
Tempelina#0898,06-Apr-18 09:32 PM,We’re actually in Seagrove this year because Seaside is full of irresponsible teens,
Rye#0666,06-Apr-18 09:32 PM,2013 was when my really annoying cousin stayed with us,

Rye#0666,06-Apr-18 09:32 PM,I like most of my cousins on that side,
Rye#0666,06-Apr-18 09:32 PM,Except like two,
Tempelina#0898,06-Apr-18 09:33 PM,I only have 3 cousins in total haha,
Rye#0666,06-Apr-18 09:33 PM,Idk how many I have lol,
Rye#0666,06-Apr-18 09:33 PM,I don't really know my dad's family,
udishab#2211,06-Apr-18 09:33 PM,i took an exotic vacation to my room for the entirety of this break!,
Tempelina#0898,06-Apr-18 09:34 PM,Both sides of my family are chock full of alcoholics so no drinking for me 🙅,
MEE6#4876,06-Apr-18 09:34 PM,"GG @Tempelina#0898, you just advanced to level 5!",
Rye#0666,06-Apr-18 09:34 PM,Exotic 😏😏😏,
Rye#0666,06-Apr-18 09:34 PM,@Tempelina#0898 Same,
Rye#0666,06-Apr-18 09:34 PM,Mainly on my mom's side,
Rye#0666,06-Apr-18 09:34 PM,It's made me very wary of drinking,
Rye#0666,06-Apr-18 09:34 PM,I'd rather not try it and become addicted,
udishab#2211,06-Apr-18 09:35 PM,yeah same,
Tempelina#0898,06-Apr-18 09:35 PM,"I’m like probably the most anti-drug, anti-alcohol person in existence because I’m so prone to it haha",
Rye#0666,06-Apr-18 09:35 PM,Considering I have mild anxiety from that side I'd say the odds are not in my favor lmao,
Rye#0666,06-Apr-18 09:36 PM,I'm not anti-drug. Like I don't care if people drink or smoke weed or anything as long as you're responsible about it and don't hurt yourself or others,
Rye#0666,06-Apr-18 09:36 PM,But I personally wouldn't do drugs,
Tempelina#0898,06-Apr-18 09:36 PM,I’ve learned too much about the biology of it to not care :/,
Tempelina#0898,06-Apr-18 09:36 PM,"But I don’t go up to people juuling and yell at them to stop, they’re the one making that decision",
Rye#0666,06-Apr-18 09:37 PM,Yeah for sure,
Rye#0666,06-Apr-18 09:37 PM,Plus there's nothing you can do,
Rye#0666,06-Apr-18 09:37 PM,Addicts have to want to help themselves,
Rye#0666,06-Apr-18 09:37 PM,I mean you can encourage them but they won't get better unless they mentally choose to want to,
Tempelina#0898,06-Apr-18 09:38 PM,And the sad part is that most people don’t give themselves that help,
Rye#0666,06-Apr-18 09:38 PM,Mhm,
Tempelina#0898,06-Apr-18 09:38 PM,(We gettin deep boys),

Does anyone have any recommendations for me? I'll just be using them for youtube and games on PC and console, I don't want anything fancy or wireless.",
waffle.dynasty#2740,07-Apr-18 08:21 PM,Do you want  ear buds or over ear headphones?,
Tempelina#0898,07-Apr-18 08:21 PM,Over ear headphones,

Tempelina#0898,07-Apr-18 08:24 PM,Can you wear them for more than five hours without them hurting your ears?,
waffle.dynasty#2740,07-Apr-18 08:27 PM,"Hard to say. I've never worn them for more than maybe 3 hours, but they haven't hurt my ears before.",
Tempelina#0898,07-Apr-18 08:27 PM,I'll wear headphones for five hours while drawing haha,
waffle.dynasty#2740,07-Apr-18 08:28 PM,My only complaint would be that after taking them off you get that weird feeling that you're still wearing something on your head.,
Tempelina#0898,07-Apr-18 08:28 PM,Ghost headphones? Hm.,
Tempelina#0898,07-Apr-18 08:28 PM,Well thank you for the suggestion,

Caw#1913,07-Apr-18 09:13 PM,Now the open back looks really weird and strange but it is the most comfortable pair of headphones I have ever owned,
Caw#1913,07-Apr-18 09:14 PM,"The only thing about open backs is that the back of the headphone is actually open, so you can hear everything in your environment and people around you can hear your music kinda quietly",
Caw#1913,07-Apr-18 09:14 PM,So if that won't work then don't even consider the open backs,
Caw#1913,07-Apr-18 09:15 PM,Trade off is music sounds a lot better,
Tempelina#0898,07-Apr-18 09:15 PM,"Alright, yeah the ones I just had did have a bit of sound leakage which I didn't much appreciate",

Rye#0666,08-Apr-18 05:16 AM,@efank#9753 @mic#7575 Yeah MARTA is known to not be very good,
Rye#0666,08-Apr-18 05:17 AM,It's pretty limited in terms of routes,
Rye#0666,08-Apr-18 05:17 AM,Especially the trains,
Tempelina#0898,08-Apr-18 08:42 AM,"Yeah, MARTA is a mixed bag. The trains are good if the routes line up with where you want to go, but if they don’t, you can still take the busses. (Yet I have a vendetta against the busses because I get stuck behind at least 3 of them on my way to school)",
Tempelina#0898,08-Apr-18 08:44 AM,"Also, if you’re thinking of getting a bike, I HIGHLY recommend you do. Tech is a very bike friendly campus and it’s how most people get around. A lot of students don’t even have or use cars because of this.",

Tempelina#0898,08-Apr-18 10:05 AM,Yeah....I wouldn’t recommend bringing your car unless you’re gonna use it at least a good few times a week. Tech really discourages bringing your car and they’ll make you really work for it if you decide to bring it.,
Tempelina#0898,08-Apr-18 10:06 AM,"Plus, parking at Tech is limited and expensive long term",
Rye#0666,08-Apr-18 10:07 AM,I mainly need it because I'll probably visit my twin brother a decent amount. He's going to UGA,
Tempelina#0898,08-Apr-18 10:07 AM,"Well then yeah, that makes sense for you to bring you car",
Tempelina#0898,08-Apr-18 10:08 AM,I just didn’t want you to bring it for the hell of it cause if you don’t have a good reason it isn’t the best idea xD,

thedragonlegacy#2854,08-Apr-18 02:16 PM,does anyone understand furry culture? ~_~ im at my brother's national chess tournament and there's a furry convention happening at the same time.,
thedragonlegacy#2854,08-Apr-18 02:16 PM,i dont understand,
8726andrew#5709,08-Apr-18 02:16 PM,Oh god,
Tempelina#0898,08-Apr-18 02:19 PM,I’ve had a friend who was a furry (emphasis on had) so I know some about it. I think it mostly revolves around characters and art or something like that...and then the suits? Kinda weird but I heard they’re like thousands of dollars,
Tempelina#0898,08-Apr-18 02:32 PM,But I had no idea there were conventions 😳,
joazlazer#2041,08-Apr-18 02:47 PM,this is an actual graph :monkaMEGA: :dying:,https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/402517390669381633/432612562631131156/furry_graph.png
Lordbobby104#0879,08-Apr-18 02:48 PM,Something I've never understood either,
Lordbobby104#0879,08-Apr-18 02:49 PM,There were a couple at my school who wore tails,
Tempelina#0898,08-Apr-18 02:51 PM,It’s just something that you should really keep to yourself but people are idiots and decide to be the weirdest they POSSIBLY can,
Lennox#3038,08-Apr-18 02:53 PM,"I've always lived under the mantra of, if they aren't hurting anybody, let em be",
thedragonlegacy#2854,08-Apr-18 02:53 PM,just did a lil surfin,
thedragonlegacy#2854,08-Apr-18 02:53 PM,it makes sense under our cultural context,
thedragonlegacy#2854,08-Apr-18 02:54 PM,"""At first glance, it seems like anthropomorphic animals are a bizarre thing to be a fan of. That is, until you realize that most North Americans today grew up watching Mickey Mouse and Bugs Bunny cartoons and reading books like The Tale of Peter Rabbit and Charlotte’s Web, and continue this proud tradition by taking our children to see the films like Zootopia.""",
waffle.dynasty#2740,08-Apr-18 02:54 PM,Oof,
thedragonlegacy#2854,08-Apr-18 02:55 PM,"also interesting stat "" Furries are seven times more likely than the general population to identify as transgender and about five times more likely to identify as non-heterosexual. Given this composition, it should come as no surprise that the furry fandom is a community defined in no small part by its inclusivity. This fandom embraces norms of being welcoming and non-judgmental to all.  """,
Tempelina#0898,08-Apr-18 02:56 PM,Oh that’s actually pretty cool,
MEE6#4876,08-Apr-18 02:56 PM,"GG @Tempelina#0898, you just advanced to level 6!",
Tempelina#0898,08-Apr-18 02:57 PM,Especially since homosexuality and transgender people are a relatively new social movement in terms of normalization,
joazlazer#2041,08-Apr-18 02:59 PM,idk when you get into sexual attraction with the actual fursuits tho,
joazlazer#2041,08-Apr-18 03:00 PM,that's just too much for me,
Tempelina#0898,08-Apr-18 03:02 PM,Yeah that crosses the line xD,
thedragonlegacy#2854,08-Apr-18 03:03 PM,"it makes sense how non-identifying/trans people can relate to anthropomorphic interests, as they are more fluid in sexuality and gender than previous social norm (as it's changing now)",
thedragonlegacy#2854,08-Apr-18 03:03 PM,"and yes, fur sexualization is too much for me too. nope, im out xD",
Gadget246#0848,08-Apr-18 03:53 PM,I have a general theory that when people are way more into something than seems justifiable at a surface level it probably means there are deeper reasons for their preference.,
Gadget246#0848,08-Apr-18 03:55 PM,"In this case those deeper reasons might be the welcoming and non-judgemental community, the anonymity that wearing a full-body costume provides, or simply the desire to express individuality and deviance from societal norms.",
Gadget246#0848,08-Apr-18 03:55 PM,Or something else entirely which hasn't occured to me,
Xephoran#1160,08-Apr-18 04:05 PM,^I was probably at that convention if it was the one in Atlanta,
thedragonlegacy#2854,08-Apr-18 04:16 PM,I agree,
thedragonlegacy#2854,08-Apr-18 04:18 PM,"Yoooo if you saw a bunch of kids at the food court with chess stuff, I was at that event",
Xephoran#1160,08-Apr-18 04:18 PM,The Peachtree center food court?,
thedragonlegacy#2854,08-Apr-18 04:30 PM,"Well, the chess tournament took place in Hyatt hotel. most kids got food at the Peachtree food court",
thedragonlegacy#2854,08-Apr-18 04:30 PM,Lol I ate there for lunch,
Xephoran#1160,08-Apr-18 04:31 PM,"Yep, might've seen that group then XD",
Tempelina#0898,08-Apr-18 04:31 PM,Awww xD,
thedragonlegacy#2854,08-Apr-18 04:31 PM,"yeah xd . that food court is a bust, so expensive",
Xephoran#1160,08-Apr-18 04:32 PM,Really? I didnt think it was that bad,
thedragonlegacy#2854,08-Apr-18 04:32 PM,it’s not that bad,
thedragonlegacy#2854,08-Apr-18 04:32 PM,Just,
Lordbobby104#0879,08-Apr-18 04:32 PM,Oh I love that food court,
Lordbobby104#0879,08-Apr-18 04:32 PM,You have to go to Gus's World Famous Fried Chicken,
Lordbobby104#0879,08-Apr-18 04:32 PM,Best fried chicken I've ever had,

Xephoran#1160,08-Apr-18 04:33 PM,"Lol, yeah, that's not that bad, I always figured most food in the city was expensive. The real problem was how bad the wait was if you went there during lunch time",

Tempelina#0898,08-Apr-18 06:50 PM,Really? If you’re in a LLC can you still have outside friendships and stuff?,
themroats#3435,08-Apr-18 06:50 PM,Interesting,
thedragonlegacy#2854,08-Apr-18 06:52 PM,"college itself is an opportunity to meet others, and i think it's up to the individual to find social opportunities at college",

8726andrew#5709,08-Apr-18 07:00 PM,From what I understand you just have the same classes as people and share the dorms so you know everyone but it’d probably be on you to meet people otherwise,
thedragonlegacy#2854,08-Apr-18 07:01 PM,"girl, if you want to do it, go for it. SMaRT seemed really cool and i would've gone for it if i was a science major (doesnt seem CS friendly lol).",
Tempelina#0898,08-Apr-18 07:03 PM,I guess if I take initiative on meeting and having friendships with other people I’ll be fine. That makes me feel so much better haha,
thedragonlegacy#2854,08-Apr-18 07:03 PM,"like bruh, make YOUR experience at college. my opinion about LLC is just a distasteful view about the college business.... as universities are a business",

Caw#1913,09-Apr-18 12:44 AM,Just prevent people from walking in,
Snowfish#4289,09-Apr-18 12:45 AM,dont even know if we're going to get the ipads for payment anyways tbh lol,
Snowfish#4289,09-Apr-18 12:45 AM,"but yeah, if any of you live near tech's campus and are bored, feel free to come down",
Snowfish#4289,09-Apr-18 12:45 AM,dont want to hard advertise if you guys cant get in for free tho,

Snowfish#4289,09-Apr-18 12:46 AM,its not going to be a big big thing,
Caw#1913,09-Apr-18 12:46 AM,Yah don't plan on it,
Caw#1913,09-Apr-18 12:47 AM,Even if I was on tech I would be hesitant to move my computer,
Caw#1913,09-Apr-18 12:47 AM,Such a pain,
Snowfish#4289,09-Apr-18 12:47 AM,yeah but there's not really a better way to do it,
Snowfish#4289,09-Apr-18 12:47 AM,like we cant have people renting shit cuz then there's a lot more security involved,
Snowfish#4289,09-Apr-18 12:47 AM,if it's just you responsible for your pc it's a lot easier than needing to make sure not every single person is sneaking out with shit,
Caw#1913,09-Apr-18 12:48 AM,I totally understand that,
Caw#1913,09-Apr-18 12:48 AM,Where on campus are you guys having it?,
Snowfish#4289,09-Apr-18 12:48 AM,the college of computing buildings,

Le Noir DragooN#8434,10-Apr-18 09:33 PM,I’m committing tomorrow ^_^,
Le Noir DragooN#8434,10-Apr-18 09:34 PM,"Funny thing is, i was admitted early action",
thedragonlegacy#2854,10-Apr-18 09:34 PM,"not by using commands, but i could make a private text channel & that would only show the >committed people online.",

Skfoos#9138,10-Apr-18 09:35 PM,"speaking of which, how does one get the committed role?",
Caw#1913,10-Apr-18 09:36 PM,Same way you just got your other rank,
Caw#1913,10-Apr-18 09:36 PM,Go to #welcome and type >rank committed,
saxon_dr#3806,10-Apr-18 09:37 PM,oh yeah i should do that too,
Skfoos#9138,10-Apr-18 09:40 PM,is there no chem role?,
thedragonlegacy#2854,10-Apr-18 09:53 PM,there should be?,

Caw#1913,10-Apr-18 09:56 PM,Last message was 1/18,
saxon_dr#3806,10-Apr-18 09:56 PM,huh AE is surprising,
saxon_dr#3806,10-Apr-18 09:56 PM,but i think there's also some selection bias here,
venom/Dean#0512,10-Apr-18 09:56 PM,Someone call an ambulance to save them!,
saxon_dr#3806,10-Apr-18 09:56 PM,maybe there're more discord users among cs majors,
Caw#1913,10-Apr-18 09:56 PM,Why is it surprising Julian?,
saxon_dr#3806,10-Apr-18 09:57 PM,i guess i thought the AE program would have more people,
Caw#1913,10-Apr-18 09:57 PM,It's actually decently small,
Caw#1913,10-Apr-18 09:57 PM,And I would definitely think that CS majors are more likely to use discord,
saxon_dr#3806,10-Apr-18 09:57 PM,oh interesting,
saxon_dr#3806,10-Apr-18 09:58 PM,yeah a lot of coding related communities online either would have a slack or discord,
Caw#1913,10-Apr-18 09:58 PM,There's only 200 AE majors,
thedragonlegacy#2854,10-Apr-18 09:58 PM,i agree,
Caw#1913,10-Apr-18 09:58 PM,From last year,
Caw#1913,10-Apr-18 09:58 PM,So I don't know if thats a lot or not,
saxon_dr#3806,10-Apr-18 09:59 PM,i also just found out that apparently a bunch of people from my school is coming,
saxon_dr#3806,10-Apr-18 09:59 PM,but i doubt most of them know what discord is,
Caw#1913,10-Apr-18 10:00 PM,You in state or OOS?,
saxon_dr#3806,10-Apr-18 10:00 PM,oos,

saxon_dr#3806,10-Apr-18 10:00 PM,well in my case i'm actually an international student,
Caw#1913,10-Apr-18 10:00 PM,Oh,
saxon_dr#3806,10-Apr-18 10:00 PM,i think around 4-5? which doesnt' sound like a lot but,
saxon_dr#3806,10-Apr-18 10:00 PM,my school only has 450 studetns,
Caw#1913,10-Apr-18 10:00 PM,Yah that's a bunch,
Caw#1913,10-Apr-18 10:01 PM,Only 4 students applied from my school and I was the only one to get in,
Caw#1913,10-Apr-18 10:01 PM,My school has 1300 students or so,
saxon_dr#3806,10-Apr-18 10:02 PM,for w/e reason tech seems to like my school,
saxon_dr#3806,10-Apr-18 10:02 PM,so i guess we like tech too,

Tempelina#0898,11-Apr-18 06:23 AM,"Yeah, there are prob a ton of people majoring in bio/biochem but I guess they aren’t as likely to have a discord 😅",
Tempelina#0898,11-Apr-18 06:25 AM,It’s interesting that the majors which have the most members on this discord are either rooted in math or engineering majors,
8726andrew#5709,11-Apr-18 06:27 AM,Most people who use discord are people who play video games so that’s probably why,

Lennox#3038,11-Apr-18 09:09 PM,A LAN event is when people all get together with computers and play video games under the same local network in the same place,
Lennox#3038,11-Apr-18 09:10 PM,"Besides just being more social, it also means you can run your own servers on the network and all have the same really fast connection",
Lennox#3038,11-Apr-18 09:11 PM,which is why most video game tournaments use LAN,
Lennox#3038,11-Apr-18 09:13 PM,TLDR: nerd congregation,
udishab#2211,11-Apr-18 09:13 PM,ohh that sounds really fun i want to try!,
udishab#2211,11-Apr-18 09:13 PM,also thanks for the explanation lol,
saxon_dr#3806,11-Apr-18 09:14 PM,what never happened?,
Gadget246#0848,11-Apr-18 09:24 PM,"LAN servers are super fast, but on the other hand, if you try to connect to the outside world with the internet you're all going to be using the same router lol",
Caw#1913,11-Apr-18 09:32 PM,"This is going to be a really odd and specific request, but are there any files online of 3d models of GATech dorms?",
Snowfish#4289,11-Apr-18 09:50 PM,"@Gadget246#0848 some people are planning to bring board games, run jackbox party pack and other games like that off theri own PCs, and i know some of the fighting games players are bringing consoles",
Snowfish#4289,11-Apr-18 09:50 PM,"and if there's nothing to do, you can just eat pizza and walk around campus then leave",
Snowfish#4289,11-Apr-18 09:50 PM,free food amirite lads,
saxon_dr#3806,11-Apr-18 09:51 PM,how often do LAN parties happen during the school year?,

kk4jrq#5652,11-Apr-18 10:20 PM,What are you making it in? I may want the CAD...,
Caw#1913,11-Apr-18 10:20 PM,Fusion 360,
kk4jrq#5652,11-Apr-18 10:20 PM,Or I guess you could just do STL,
Caw#1913,11-Apr-18 10:20 PM,It will probably be of a Tower/Glenn room btw,
kk4jrq#5652,11-Apr-18 10:21 PM,"Yeah I can make the room, but if you CAD the furniture, that's all the same",
Caw#1913,11-Apr-18 10:21 PM,It's going to be a really rough model of the furniture,
kk4jrq#5652,11-Apr-18 10:22 PM,Yeah that's all good,
kk4jrq#5652,11-Apr-18 10:22 PM,Just get the major dimensions... That's all that matters,
Caw#1913,11-Apr-18 10:23 PM,Yep,

Caw#1913,11-Apr-18 10:24 PM,Hmmm,
Caw#1913,11-Apr-18 10:24 PM,Towers has 1 more inch of wall,
Caw#1913,11-Apr-18 10:25 PM,Man that's a really tough choice,
kk4jrq#5652,11-Apr-18 10:25 PM,I think all the rooms varry a little bit tho...,
Caw#1913,11-Apr-18 10:25 PM,They do,
kk4jrq#5652,11-Apr-18 10:25 PM,So everything is within a tolerance,
Caw#1913,11-Apr-18 10:25 PM,But man,

thedragonlegacy#2854,16-Apr-18 06:15 PM,what have y’all been up to lately?,
Caw#1913,16-Apr-18 06:15 PM,Does not doing my classwork count as doing something?,
Caw#1913,16-Apr-18 06:15 PM,Because if so I've been really busy,
saxon_dr#3806,16-Apr-18 06:18 PM,i've been actually finding fortnite pretty fun since sunday so i'm trying to not be trash at it xd,
saxon_dr#3806,16-Apr-18 06:18 PM,other than that not much,
thedragonlegacy#2854,16-Apr-18 06:19 PM,"Me too Cawald, I’ve been extremely busy",
thedragonlegacy#2854,16-Apr-18 06:20 PM,O? thinking about trying fortnite once senior skip month hits,
saxon_dr#3806,16-Apr-18 06:21 PM,it's pretty hard but i think the good thing about battle royale is that you can be really bad at the game and still enjoy it,
saxon_dr#3806,16-Apr-18 06:21 PM,especially if you play with friends,
Caw#1913,16-Apr-18 06:28 PM,Fortnite isn't my kind of game but in general battle Royale games are super fun,
Rye#0666,16-Apr-18 06:31 PM,I got bored of it after I won,
Rye#0666,16-Apr-18 06:31 PM,Didn't feel rewarding anymore,
Caw#1913,16-Apr-18 06:32 PM,Which is why I'll never get bored of it,
Lennox#3038,16-Apr-18 06:34 PM,"I only play with friends, and it's quite fun",
udishab#2211,16-Apr-18 06:34 PM,oh yes everyone's playing fortnite is it worth joining the hype?,
Rye#0666,16-Apr-18 06:34 PM,Try it out,
Rye#0666,16-Apr-18 06:34 PM,It's free,
Rye#0666,16-Apr-18 06:35 PM,"If you like it, keep playing",
Rye#0666,16-Apr-18 06:35 PM,"If not, then don't",
Rye#0666,16-Apr-18 06:35 PM,Worst outcome is that you don't like it and you just uninstall it,
thedragonlegacy#2854,16-Apr-18 06:38 PM,downloaded it over school wifi for the lulz,
Caw#1913,16-Apr-18 06:38 PM,Even better,
thedragonlegacy#2854,16-Apr-18 06:38 PM,will maybe play it sometime in may,
Caw#1913,16-Apr-18 06:38 PM,Download it to the schools computers,
thedragonlegacy#2854,16-Apr-18 06:39 PM,(couldn't connect to server to play tho),
Caw#1913,16-Apr-18 06:39 PM,Pull a hackerman,
Caw#1913,16-Apr-18 06:39 PM,...somehow,
Lennox#3038,16-Apr-18 06:39 PM,People at my school have found a way,
thedragonlegacy#2854,16-Apr-18 06:40 PM,laptop vpns?,
Lennox#3038,16-Apr-18 06:40 PM,Probably,
waffle.dynasty#2740,16-Apr-18 06:40 PM,That's what people at my school do,
Lennox#3038,16-Apr-18 06:41 PM,The administration is gradually banning all the VPNs they find though,
Lennox#3038,16-Apr-18 06:41 PM,meaning kids are getting super sketchy with their vpn choice,
Lennox#3038,16-Apr-18 06:42 PM,"or maybe that's not how it works at all and I sound dumb, idk",
Lennox#3038,16-Apr-18 06:42 PM,never used one* (except I just remembered using one to get those sweet sweet early AP scores),
thedragonlegacy#2854,16-Apr-18 06:42 PM,you can definitely have sketchy vpn choices,
thedragonlegacy#2854,16-Apr-18 06:43 PM,psiphon for windows is pretty fye,
Caw#1913,16-Apr-18 06:45 PM,Although once you have it installed they can't block it right?,
thedragonlegacy#2854,16-Apr-18 06:46 PM,they can if they know what software to block,
thedragonlegacy#2854,16-Apr-18 06:50 PM,"the problem is that you must use the school wifi server for the VPN to connect. any downloaded software that uses wifi essentially submits ""requests"" to router (IIRC ;;/)",
thedragonlegacy#2854,16-Apr-18 06:51 PM,"schools have ""firewalls"" in place;; they basically intercept and identify those ""requests""",
thedragonlegacy#2854,16-Apr-18 06:51 PM,and then judge what to do w/ them,
thedragonlegacy#2854,16-Apr-18 06:52 PM,"so if ya boi XX VPN gets known, BG. IT dude finds the unique address and bans it",
thedragonlegacy#2854,16-Apr-18 06:52 PM,someone correct me if im wrong,
Lennox#3038,16-Apr-18 06:52 PM,"makes ""sense""",
Lennox#3038,16-Apr-18 06:53 PM,"Do any of you use VPN's for casual use, like at home?",
Lennox#3038,16-Apr-18 06:54 PM,I've heard of some people who swear by them,
Caw#1913,16-Apr-18 06:55 PM,See I don't think my county IT guys would be smart enough to do that Marissa,
Caw#1913,16-Apr-18 06:56 PM,I think they only block the download,
Chafos#1781,16-Apr-18 07:04 PM,I made a couple of accounts for this one called tunnel bear but it’s like 1 GB per account and then you have to pay and that GB actually goes really fast,
thedragonlegacy#2854,16-Apr-18 07:08 PM,"i don't casually use vpns, not rlly a hakr nor do i sell organs on black market",

saxon_dr#3806,17-Apr-18 01:59 AM,she was the first woman to ever set a speed record for hiking,
saxon_dr#3806,17-Apr-18 01:59 AM,and she did it on the appalachian trail,
Snowfish#4289,17-Apr-18 01:59 AM,there’s hiking races?,
saxon_dr#3806,17-Apr-18 01:59 AM,well it's not a race but,
saxon_dr#3806,17-Apr-18 01:59 AM,you just start off in maine and then there's like stations on the way,
saxon_dr#3806,17-Apr-18 01:59 AM,and at the end they record your time,
saxon_dr#3806,17-Apr-18 02:00 AM,so you're competing with the previous people but just competing with their time,

udishab#2211,17-Apr-18 09:59 AM,short appreciation text for @Snowfish#4289 for being there to answer all of our gt questions lol,
saxon_dr#3806,17-Apr-18 10:00 AM,yeah snowfish is awesome :lilyComfy:,
Snowfish#4289,17-Apr-18 10:17 AM,sorry i fell asleep,
Snowfish#4289,17-Apr-18 10:18 AM,i had a buddy who was there for me when i was super anxious about everything so i feel like i gotta give back yknow,
Snowfish#4289,17-Apr-18 10:18 AM,pass it on etc,
saxon_dr#3806,17-Apr-18 10:24 AM,still nice of you to do this tho,
saxon_dr#3806,17-Apr-18 10:24 AM,and your pfp just makes it all even better,
udishab#2211,17-Apr-18 10:26 AM,that's kurisu right lol,
saxon_dr#3806,17-Apr-18 10:29 AM,chibi kurisu to be exact,
Snowfish#4289,17-Apr-18 11:56 AM,hell yeah,
Snowfish#4289,17-Apr-18 11:56 AM,kurisu is best girl,
saxon_dr#3806,17-Apr-18 12:01 PM,btw you said that you're not watchign sg 0 right,
Snowfish#4289,17-Apr-18 12:01 PM,i caved,
Snowfish#4289,17-Apr-18 12:01 PM,im gonna watch it,
Snowfish#4289,17-Apr-18 12:01 PM,i played the VN and it made me unhappy so im prepared to be made unhappy by s;g0,
saxon_dr#3806,17-Apr-18 12:02 PM,i think it could be ok,
saxon_dr#3806,17-Apr-18 12:02 PM,but then ofc idk what actually happens in it,
Snowfish#4289,17-Apr-18 12:03 PM,my biggest gripe with it is the fact that the whole idea is that kurisu is dead but they basically shoehorn 3 more characters in that are basically reskinned kurisus,
Snowfish#4289,17-Apr-18 12:03 PM,like why bother to kill her off at that poit,
Snowfish#4289,17-Apr-18 12:04 PM,but its more steins;gate so i do what i must,
saxon_dr#3806,17-Apr-18 12:04 PM,so he never saves her,
saxon_dr#3806,17-Apr-18 12:04 PM,?,
saxon_dr#3806,17-Apr-18 12:04 PM,:PepeHands:,
Snowfish#4289,17-Apr-18 12:04 PM,well that's the whole plot yknow,
Snowfish#4289,17-Apr-18 12:04 PM,that you're in an alternate timeline where he didnt go back the second time,
saxon_dr#3806,17-Apr-18 12:04 PM,i thought he was gonna like go back in the timeline and then save her again later,
saxon_dr#3806,17-Apr-18 12:04 PM,idk,
Snowfish#4289,17-Apr-18 12:04 PM,i say nothing,
saxon_dr#3806,17-Apr-18 12:04 PM,i haven't looked into the plot that much,
Snowfish#4289,17-Apr-18 12:04 PM,the 3 reskinned kurisus will probably be here by episode 2,
Snowfish#4289,17-Apr-18 12:05 PM,already got maho,
Snowfish#4289,17-Apr-18 12:05 PM,so 1/3,
saxon_dr#3806,17-Apr-18 12:05 PM,the short green haired girl?,
Snowfish#4289,17-Apr-18 12:05 PM,yea,
saxon_dr#3806,17-Apr-18 12:05 PM,hmm,
Snowfish#4289,17-Apr-18 12:05 PM,the other 2 are pretty obviously trying to be kurisu,
saxon_dr#3806,17-Apr-18 12:05 PM,oh,
saxon_dr#3806,17-Apr-18 12:05 PM,hmm that sounds like a lot of frustration,
saxon_dr#3806,17-Apr-18 12:05 PM,i'll see as it goes i guess,
Snowfish#4289,17-Apr-18 12:06 PM,the story is still alright it just annoyed me,
saxon_dr#3806,17-Apr-18 12:06 PM,yeah i get it,
Snowfish#4289,17-Apr-18 12:06 PM,i can dig what it does with okabe though so i'll give it a pass,
saxon_dr#3806,17-Apr-18 12:06 PM,it's like last week's darling in the franxx episode,
Snowfish#4289,17-Apr-18 12:06 PM,suffering okabe is best okabe,
saxon_dr#3806,17-Apr-18 12:06 PM,i was so upset by that,
saxon_dr#3806,17-Apr-18 12:06 PM,:chewieREEE:,
Snowfish#4289,17-Apr-18 12:06 PM,"""oh god we have 10 more episodes time to make contrived drama by **MISUNDERSTANDINGS**""",
Snowfish#4289,17-Apr-18 12:07 PM,like the whole hiro/02 leaving their rooms at the same time,
saxon_dr#3806,17-Apr-18 12:07 PM,but i think the good thing about this season is that there are so many good anime out there that if one of them annoys me there are other anime to make me feel better,
Snowfish#4289,17-Apr-18 12:07 PM,solid 😡,
saxon_dr#3806,17-Apr-18 12:07 PM,yeah that shit i was like,
saxon_dr#3806,17-Apr-18 12:07 PM,:chewieREEE: nooooo,
saxon_dr#3806,17-Apr-18 12:07 PM,don't do that shit,
Snowfish#4289,17-Apr-18 12:08 PM,i expected better from ditf,
Snowfish#4289,17-Apr-18 12:08 PM,since the world building and character development has been pretty solid thus far,
saxon_dr#3806,17-Apr-18 12:08 PM,i just want their relationship to all get resolved so we can move onto the politics stuff,
Snowfish#4289,17-Apr-18 12:09 PM,you seem to forget that you're watching anime in 2018 sir,
saxon_dr#3806,17-Apr-18 12:09 PM,no i mean i like the relationship aspect,
saxon_dr#3806,17-Apr-18 12:09 PM,i just feel like we've been stuck on the same plot conflict for like 5 episodes,
Snowfish#4289,17-Apr-18 12:09 PM,its gonna be like 5 more,
Snowfish#4289,17-Apr-18 12:09 PM,unless some real shit hits the fan,
Snowfish#4289,17-Apr-18 12:10 PM,they're building up a lot of plots,
saxon_dr#3806,17-Apr-18 12:10 PM,yeah,
Snowfish#4289,17-Apr-18 12:10 PM,i just hope they dont throw it all together in the last 3 episodes,
Snowfish#4289,17-Apr-18 12:10 PM,that'll make me real sad,
saxon_dr#3806,17-Apr-18 12:10 PM,they're doing all kinds of setup i hope that they do good stuff with them,
Snowfish#4289,17-Apr-18 12:10 PM,one can only hope,
saxon_dr#3806,17-Apr-18 12:10 PM,i'd rather they make us wait for a second season than some rushed ending,
Snowfish#4289,17-Apr-18 12:11 PM,i can only hope that ichigo dies in the next like 2 episodes,
saxon_dr#3806,17-Apr-18 12:11 PM,lol,
Snowfish#4289,17-Apr-18 12:11 PM,NTR-machine since episode 1,
Snowfish#4289,17-Apr-18 12:11 PM,god bless,
saxon_dr#3806,17-Apr-18 12:11 PM,did you know that some fans are sending the CV death threats,
saxon_dr#3806,17-Apr-18 12:11 PM,these people gotta chill out,
Snowfish#4289,17-Apr-18 12:12 PM,yeah i know,
Snowfish#4289,17-Apr-18 12:12 PM,it wasnt even that bad,
saxon_dr#3806,17-Apr-18 12:12 PM,if anything this means that she played the character well,
Snowfish#4289,17-Apr-18 12:12 PM,like sure it kinda sucked but it's lobviously gonna be resolved,
Snowfish#4289,17-Apr-18 12:12 PM,now if THAT was the last episode,
Snowfish#4289,17-Apr-18 12:12 PM,i could understand,
Snowfish#4289,17-Apr-18 12:12 PM,but there's 10 more y'all,
saxon_dr#3806,17-Apr-18 12:12 PM,yeah they're not gonna make hiro and zero two not work out,
saxon_dr#3806,17-Apr-18 12:13 PM,at least they will have some good moments,
Snowfish#4289,17-Apr-18 12:13 PM,people are silly,

Gadget246#0848,17-Apr-18 10:33 PM,having a weird name is nice imo because nobody ever gets confused about who someone means,
udishab#2211,17-Apr-18 10:35 PM,yess it's so easy to find usernames on sites too,
thedragonlegacy#2854,17-Apr-18 10:41 PM,the worst part about having an almost-common name is hearing a similar-sounding name being called out in a crowd,
thedragonlegacy#2854,17-Apr-18 10:41 PM,looking around and/or replying,
thedragonlegacy#2854,17-Apr-18 10:41 PM,and feeling dumb,
udishab#2211,17-Apr-18 10:42 PM,idk many ppl named marissa tho,
thedragonlegacy#2854,17-Apr-18 10:42 PM,"melissa, alyssa",
thedragonlegacy#2854,17-Apr-18 10:42 PM,sounds the same if you don't pay attention to your surroundings,
udishab#2211,17-Apr-18 10:42 PM,ohh yes that makes sense,
Snowfish#4289,17-Apr-18 10:42 PM,i think im gonna legally have my name changed to nicole,

Snowfish#4289,17-Apr-18 10:43 PM,"NAD HE SAID ""THAT'S HOW IT'S SPELLED""",
Snowfish#4289,17-Apr-18 10:43 PM,its not even a creative reason,
Snowfish#4289,17-Apr-18 10:43 PM,he's just SILLY,

Snowfish#4289,17-Apr-18 10:43 PM,idk why my mom didnt stop him,
Snowfish#4289,17-Apr-18 10:44 PM,no,
thedragonlegacy#2854,17-Apr-18 10:44 PM,maybe he wanted to steal a T from his name,
Snowfish#4289,17-Apr-18 10:44 PM,lmao,
Snowfish#4289,17-Apr-18 10:44 PM,then why did i get an H,
thedragonlegacy#2854,17-Apr-18 10:45 PM,maybe,
thedragonlegacy#2854,17-Apr-18 10:45 PM,your name is actually pronounced,
thedragonlegacy#2854,17-Apr-18 10:45 PM,nic-HOLE,
Gadget246#0848,17-Apr-18 10:46 PM,"the thing about my name is that when southern people put a second syllable in the word ""sure"" it sounds enough like my name to get my attention XD",
udishab#2211,17-Apr-18 10:46 PM,what if instead of the ch making a k sound it makes a ch sound like in chocolate so her name is like nitch-ole,
Gadget246#0848,17-Apr-18 10:47 PM,so even though no other name sounds like mine i still think people are saying my name when they aren't,
Snowfish#4289,17-Apr-18 10:47 PM,pls no,
Snowfish#4289,17-Apr-18 10:47 PM,that's what everyone called me in high school,

thedragonlegacy#2854,17-Apr-18 10:48 PM,how do you pronounce your name? shoe-ler?,
Gadget246#0848,17-Apr-18 10:48 PM,exactly like that,
Gadget246#0848,17-Apr-18 10:48 PM,that is actually how i explain to people how to pronounce it,
Snowfish#4289,17-Apr-18 10:48 PM,so its pronounced like german,
Gadget246#0848,17-Apr-18 10:48 PM,no,
Snowfish#4289,17-Apr-18 10:48 PM,wat,
Gadget246#0848,17-Apr-18 10:48 PM,the german word Schueler,
Gadget246#0848,17-Apr-18 10:48 PM,is not how you pronounce my name,

Gadget246#0848,17-Apr-18 10:49 PM,"my name does not have an umlaut in it, but yes you read it with the phonetic system of german",
Snowfish#4289,17-Apr-18 10:49 PM,ok thanks,
Snowfish#4289,17-Apr-18 10:49 PM,that's what i was asking,
Gadget246#0848,17-Apr-18 10:49 PM,"oh ok, yeah",
Snowfish#4289,17-Apr-18 10:49 PM,i can see there's no umlaut SILLY,
Gadget246#0848,17-Apr-18 10:50 PM,"sorry, a lot of people are like ""oh it's just the german word"", and then they try to pronounce the umlaut (and can't) and it's just a mess",
Snowfish#4289,17-Apr-18 10:50 PM,my grandma's maiden name is schuster,
Gadget246#0848,17-Apr-18 10:50 PM,@thedragonlegacy#2854 I like that one,
Gadget246#0848,17-Apr-18 10:50 PM,that's a new one,
Snowfish#4289,17-Apr-18 10:51 PM,its like the same thing,
Gadget246#0848,17-Apr-18 10:53 PM,"I have definitely been nicknamed schuster before, along with:, Schneider, Shoes, Schoolboy Littlefield (literal translation of the german words my name looks like), Schules, etc, and those are just the ones that I'm ok with people using",
Gadget246#0848,17-Apr-18 10:53 PM,and Sneakers (because shoes),
Snowfish#4289,17-Apr-18 10:54 PM,schoolboy littlefield,
Snowfish#4289,17-Apr-18 10:54 PM,hahahahaa,
Snowfish#4289,17-Apr-18 10:54 PM,ill call you shoe,
Gadget246#0848,17-Apr-18 10:56 PM,"that one is usually shortened to schoolboy, which works because i'm a nerd, i don't mind being called shoe but it sounds too much like a word and not a name so it doesn't get my attention well",
Snowfish#4289,17-Apr-18 10:57 PM,well,
Snowfish#4289,17-Apr-18 10:57 PM,what if i call you schu,
Snowfish#4289,17-Apr-18 10:57 PM,but i pronounce it shoe,
Snowfish#4289,17-Apr-18 10:58 PM,:EZ:,
Gadget246#0848,17-Apr-18 11:01 PM,"schu works fine in discord, but if you end up yelling ""Shoe!"" repeatedly to try to get my attention and just end up looking silly don't say I didn't warn you 😂",
thedragonlegacy#2854,17-Apr-18 11:12 PM,How about,
thedragonlegacy#2854,17-Apr-18 11:12 PM,Schelter XD,
thedragonlegacy#2854,17-Apr-18 11:12 PM,“Let’s all find Schelter!”,
thedragonlegacy#2854,17-Apr-18 11:13 PM,Xdddd,
Snowfish#4289,17-Apr-18 11:18 PM,who was it who pinged me while i was sleeping btw,
Snowfish#4289,17-Apr-18 11:18 PM,i had to go to demo a project and i completely forgot who it was,
Snowfish#4289,17-Apr-18 11:18 PM,:PepeHands:,
mic#7575,17-Apr-18 11:34 PM,Wait so what does Schuler mean if not schoolkid,
mic#7575,17-Apr-18 11:41 PM,"I thought the German ü was pronounced the same as the Mandarin ü, but the way Google Translate pronounced Schüler it sounds exactly like a u to me :Thonk_transparent:",
Gadget246#0848,17-Apr-18 11:45 PM,"schuler would be some weird form of the word student if I remember my german correctly (big if), it would be something along the lines of the plural in a certain noun case i think",
mic#7575,17-Apr-18 11:46 PM,that's quite a name to give to your kid,
Gadget246#0848,17-Apr-18 11:47 PM,"Schüler (pronounced not the way google translate pronounced it) would be fluently translated to student, but technically means 'male student' and would literally be schoolboy",
Gadget246#0848,17-Apr-18 11:48 PM,it was originally not spelled the way mine is spelled (i was named after my great grandfather) but everyone pronounced it wrong with the original spelling so my parents made it (slightly) easier to pronounce,
mic#7575,17-Apr-18 11:51 PM,ahhh,
mic#7575,17-Apr-18 11:53 PM,yeah until now I thought Mueller was pronounced Mweller,
mic#7575,17-Apr-18 11:55 PM,instead it's /ˈmʏlɐ/ which has some weird vowels I don't understand,
Gadget246#0848,17-Apr-18 11:59 PM,the way to pronounce an umlaut is to make the shape with your mouth that you would normally make to pronounce the vowel and then try to say the letter E without changing the shape of your mouth,
mic#7575,18-Apr-18 12:06 AM,I don't know if that's possible...,
Gadget246#0848,18-Apr-18 12:10 AM,you can move your tongue a little bit closer to the roof of your mouth,
Gadget246#0848,18-Apr-18 12:10 AM,"(and should), but don't change your lip shape",
Snowfish#4289,18-Apr-18 12:10 AM,"damn it i saw ""tongue"" and ""roof of your mouth"" and now i'm aware of my tongue touching the roof of my mouth",
Snowfish#4289,18-Apr-18 12:11 AM,like that stupid meme,
Gadget246#0848,18-Apr-18 12:11 AM,"Whoopsie, sorry about that 😂",
IceF1ame#8123,18-Apr-18 12:12 AM,@Snowfish#4289  I’m the one that pinged u lol,
Snowfish#4289,18-Apr-18 12:12 AM,oh sup,
IceF1ame#8123,18-Apr-18 12:12 AM,lol,
IceF1ame#8123,18-Apr-18 12:12 AM,"my main question was how much freetime on avg do u have a day, how much do u sleep, and how stressed do u usually feel",
Snowfish#4289,18-Apr-18 12:13 AM,first year i had a ton of free time,
Snowfish#4289,18-Apr-18 12:13 AM,this year i've been working part-time so,
Snowfish#4289,18-Apr-18 12:13 AM,not so much,
Snowfish#4289,18-Apr-18 12:13 AM,i dont sleep as much as i should but i still sleep pretty decently (like 7 hours a night avg) but that's just cuz i play too many video games,
saxon_dr#3806,18-Apr-18 12:14 AM,games for sleep is always a good decision :SeemsGood:,
Snowfish#4289,18-Apr-18 12:14 AM,average stress i'd say like a 5 overall but like a 8 this semester cuz i keep getting assignments and exams at the same time :PepeHands:,
IceF1ame#8123,18-Apr-18 12:14 AM,lol rip,
IceF1ame#8123,18-Apr-18 12:15 AM,do u think u can put a number to academics v homework/studies v freetime a day,
Snowfish#4289,18-Apr-18 12:15 AM,like,
IceF1ame#8123,18-Apr-18 12:15 AM,and also how bad are the weeder classes,
Snowfish#4289,18-Apr-18 12:15 AM,hours?,
IceF1ame#8123,18-Apr-18 12:15 AM,ye,
Snowfish#4289,18-Apr-18 12:15 AM,uhhh,
Snowfish#4289,18-Apr-18 12:15 AM,my classes are like 3hr/day,
Snowfish#4289,18-Apr-18 12:15 AM,that's pretty standard,
Snowfish#4289,18-Apr-18 12:15 AM,i usually work/study for like 3 hours average a day,
Snowfish#4289,18-Apr-18 12:16 AM,obviously it varies,
IceF1ame#8123,18-Apr-18 12:16 AM,oh wow,
IceF1ame#8123,18-Apr-18 12:16 AM,so not even that much,
Snowfish#4289,18-Apr-18 12:16 AM,it really depends on the class,
IceF1ame#8123,18-Apr-18 12:16 AM,cs is ez first yr then?,
Snowfish#4289,18-Apr-18 12:16 AM,easiness of classes is honestly super relative,
Snowfish#4289,18-Apr-18 12:17 AM,like i've had classes that were a complete joke for me that i had buddies struggling real bad in and vice versa,
Snowfish#4289,18-Apr-18 12:17 AM,it just depends on what clicks for you,
Snowfish#4289,18-Apr-18 12:17 AM,like CS is easy as shit for me,
IceF1ame#8123,18-Apr-18 12:17 AM,is it mostly learning to progeam first yr?,
IceF1ame#8123,18-Apr-18 12:18 AM,or do u get into comp theory,
Snowfish#4289,18-Apr-18 12:18 AM,comp theory is like,
Snowfish#4289,18-Apr-18 12:18 AM,3rd semester,
Snowfish#4289,18-Apr-18 12:18 AM,with 2110,
Snowfish#4289,18-Apr-18 12:18 AM,"first year is basic python, then basic java",
IceF1ame#8123,18-Apr-18 12:18 AM,omg...,
IceF1ame#8123,18-Apr-18 12:18 AM,wtf,
Snowfish#4289,18-Apr-18 12:18 AM,rest is all general education,
IceF1ame#8123,18-Apr-18 12:18 AM,I’m fluent in both,
IceF1ame#8123,18-Apr-18 12:18 AM,lol dafuq,
Snowfish#4289,18-Apr-18 12:18 AM,like,
IceF1ame#8123,18-Apr-18 12:18 AM,so i literally do nothing,
Snowfish#4289,18-Apr-18 12:18 AM,"lab sciences, math, english, etc etc",
Snowfish#4289,18-Apr-18 12:18 AM,yep pretty much,
IceF1ame#8123,18-Apr-18 12:18 AM,well then,
Snowfish#4289,18-Apr-18 12:18 AM,that's all majors though,
saxon_dr#3806,18-Apr-18 12:18 AM,there's no C++ in the first year?,
saxon_dr#3806,18-Apr-18 12:19 AM,o.0,
Snowfish#4289,18-Apr-18 12:19 AM,you dont get C++ at all,
Snowfish#4289,18-Apr-18 12:19 AM,you just get C and assembly,
IceF1ame#8123,18-Apr-18 12:19 AM,teaching myself c++ rn,
IceF1ame#8123,18-Apr-18 12:19 AM,what,
IceF1ame#8123,18-Apr-18 12:19 AM,why dont they go more in it,
Snowfish#4289,18-Apr-18 12:19 AM,i mean,
Snowfish#4289,18-Apr-18 12:19 AM,you dont really learn programming languages tbh,
Snowfish#4289,18-Apr-18 12:19 AM,at least not in any of the classes i've taken,
Snowfish#4289,18-Apr-18 12:19 AM,"you learn python, then java, then assembly, then c",
Snowfish#4289,18-Apr-18 12:19 AM,and the rest is all theory or more of those 4,
saxon_dr#3806,18-Apr-18 12:19 AM,yeah that's fair it's just that i know some schools do C rather than java or python in the first year,
saxon_dr#3806,18-Apr-18 12:20 AM,so i was wondering if we do that too,
Snowfish#4289,18-Apr-18 12:20 AM,nah,
Snowfish#4289,18-Apr-18 12:20 AM,i think python -> java -> c is better anyway,
saxon_dr#3806,18-Apr-18 12:20 AM,yeah python is so clean,
Snowfish#4289,18-Apr-18 12:20 AM,its definitely better for teaching,
saxon_dr#3806,18-Apr-18 12:20 AM,tru tru,
IceF1ame#8123,18-Apr-18 12:21 AM,snow how many GEs do u have to take a sem,
saxon_dr#3806,18-Apr-18 12:21 AM,how much of your time would you say is devoted to club time?,
IceF1ame#8123,18-Apr-18 12:21 AM,and also how hard are the GEs,
IceF1ame#8123,18-Apr-18 12:21 AM,and how much of a choice to what GE do u have,
IceF1ame#8123,18-Apr-18 12:21 AM,lol srry for spam,
Snowfish#4289,18-Apr-18 12:21 AM,lmao my version of club time is not the standard,
Snowfish#4289,18-Apr-18 12:22 AM,"only club i ever gave a shit about was the esports club, i set up inhouses and played in a collegiate league my first year so it was honestly like 20 hours but it was all gaming so it was aite",
Snowfish#4289,18-Apr-18 12:22 AM,im the VP now so its obviously a little more intense,
Snowfish#4289,18-Apr-18 12:22 AM,but clubs are supposed to be kinda chill and stuff you enjoy so it should never be an issue for you imo imo,
Snowfish#4289,18-Apr-18 12:22 AM,and if it is you shouldnt be doing it,
Snowfish#4289,18-Apr-18 12:22 AM,anyways about GE,
Snowfish#4289,18-Apr-18 12:22 AM,you dont really have much of a choice,
Snowfish#4289,18-Apr-18 12:22 AM,to be quite honest,
saxon_dr#3806,18-Apr-18 12:22 AM,yeah i wanted to join the esports club,
IceF1ame#8123,18-Apr-18 12:22 AM,so I have to take a specific class,
Snowfish#4289,18-Apr-18 12:22 AM,yeah more or less,
IceF1ame#8123,18-Apr-18 12:22 AM,and not a choice of a coupla classes from a category,
Snowfish#4289,18-Apr-18 12:23 AM,sure you got like somewhat of a choice but usually you're forced to take something that fits your schedule and has seats,
Snowfish#4289,18-Apr-18 12:23 AM,"like you can choose poltiics, history 1, or history 2 but history 2 is the only thing open",
Snowfish#4289,18-Apr-18 12:23 AM,etc,
Snowfish#4289,18-Apr-18 12:23 AM,they aren't super hard though,
Snowfish#4289,18-Apr-18 12:23 AM,most of the time you get lots of extra credit and curving,
Snowfish#4289,18-Apr-18 12:23 AM,i like the esports club,
Snowfish#4289,18-Apr-18 12:24 AM,apparently it's a lot more chill than a lot of the other big organizations,
Snowfish#4289,18-Apr-18 12:24 AM,like i know people in some really serious clubs,
Snowfish#4289,18-Apr-18 12:24 AM,like you cant miss 3 meetings or you get dropped,
Snowfish#4289,18-Apr-18 12:24 AM,we just have pizza and play memes for an hour a week,
saxon_dr#3806,18-Apr-18 12:24 AM,so something that i've always kinda feel bad about is that i never get to go to any gaming or anime related cons and stuff,
IceF1ame#8123,18-Apr-18 12:24 AM,So the curve isnt meant for like grade deflation?,
saxon_dr#3806,18-Apr-18 12:24 AM,does the esports club do events like that often?,
Snowfish#4289,18-Apr-18 12:24 AM,we had a LAN last weekend,
Snowfish#4289,18-Apr-18 12:25 AM,and we're gonna be bringing back a gaming convention that used to be annual at tech,
saxon_dr#3806,18-Apr-18 12:25 AM,oh cool cool,
Snowfish#4289,18-Apr-18 12:25 AM,it'll be in the fall semester this year so you'll probably hear about it,
Snowfish#4289,18-Apr-18 12:25 AM,there's also momocon which is kinda close with tech since it spawned from us,
Snowfish#4289,18-Apr-18 12:25 AM,so a loooot of tech students go,
Snowfish#4289,18-Apr-18 12:25 AM,even if they dont give a shit about anime,
saxon_dr#3806,18-Apr-18 12:25 AM,cool,
Snowfish#4289,18-Apr-18 12:26 AM,"@IceF1ame#8123 dunno what you mean by that, it's mostly like points back on tests if everyone did poorly etc in my experience",
IceF1ame#8123,18-Apr-18 12:26 AM,like at berkeley,
IceF1ame#8123,18-Apr-18 12:26 AM,if u have a 90 it can become a 85,
Snowfish#4289,18-Apr-18 12:26 AM,no,
IceF1ame#8123,18-Apr-18 12:26 AM,to fit the number of As allowed per class,
Snowfish#4289,18-Apr-18 12:26 AM,it never goes down,
Snowfish#4289,18-Apr-18 12:26 AM,never ever,
IceF1ame#8123,18-Apr-18 12:26 AM,aight gr8,
IceF1ame#8123,18-Apr-18 12:27 AM,hows the social environment?,
Snowfish#4289,18-Apr-18 12:27 AM,that's pretty broad,
IceF1ame#8123,18-Apr-18 12:27 AM,so the nerds do have personalities,
IceF1ame#8123,18-Apr-18 12:27 AM,and wont be boring to be with,
Snowfish#4289,18-Apr-18 12:27 AM,i mean,
Snowfish#4289,18-Apr-18 12:27 AM,there's pletny of boring people,
Snowfish#4289,18-Apr-18 12:28 AM,but that's any social environment,
IceF1ame#8123,18-Apr-18 12:28 AM,thats true,
saxon_dr#3806,18-Apr-18 12:28 AM,...,
IceF1ame#8123,18-Apr-18 12:28 AM,idk what I’m saying,
Snowfish#4289,18-Apr-18 12:28 AM,there's a lot of people and you'll be seeing a lot of faces,
saxon_dr#3806,18-Apr-18 12:28 AM,depends on what you mean by boring i guess,
Snowfish#4289,18-Apr-18 12:28 AM,there's someone you can get along with,
IceF1ame#8123,18-Apr-18 12:28 AM,thats true,
IceF1ame#8123,18-Apr-18 12:28 AM,itll be fine,
saxon_dr#3806,18-Apr-18 12:28 AM,i feel like the important thing is that the community is diverse enough that you can find someone you enjoy talking to,
Snowfish#4289,18-Apr-18 12:28 AM,yeah,
Snowfish#4289,18-Apr-18 12:28 AM,that's what i was saying but put a lot more eloquently,
Snowfish#4289,18-Apr-18 12:28 AM,:FeelsBadMan:,
saxon_dr#3806,18-Apr-18 12:29 AM,<a:pepeClap:394000238739849236>,
IceF1ame#8123,18-Apr-18 12:29 AM,:Thonk_transparent:,
saxon_dr#3806,18-Apr-18 12:29 AM,i used to have a spinning thonk emote,
saxon_dr#3806,18-Apr-18 12:29 AM,idk where it went,
IceF1ame#8123,18-Apr-18 12:29 AM,dudee,
IceF1ame#8123,18-Apr-18 12:29 AM,u need it back,
saxon_dr#3806,18-Apr-18 12:29 AM,i should go find a server that has it,
saxon_dr#3806,18-Apr-18 12:30 AM,actually i could just add it to my own server that i have just for the emotes,
IceF1ame#8123,18-Apr-18 12:30 AM,oh lol this is a stupid question but @Snowfish#4289 hows the 2:1 boy girl ratio😂,
IceF1ame#8123,18-Apr-18 12:30 AM,ye,
IceF1ame#8123,18-Apr-18 12:30 AM,u gotta get hat back,
Snowfish#4289,18-Apr-18 12:30 AM,i really dont see it tbh,
Snowfish#4289,18-Apr-18 12:30 AM,its more like 60/40,
Snowfish#4289,18-Apr-18 12:30 AM,like every gen-ed class i've had is like,
Snowfish#4289,18-Apr-18 12:30 AM,split more or less down the middle,
Snowfish#4289,18-Apr-18 12:30 AM,now cs classes on the other hand,
Snowfish#4289,18-Apr-18 12:30 AM,:PepeHands:,
Snowfish#4289,18-Apr-18 12:31 AM,i've had 50 person CS classes with legit 2 girls,
Snowfish#4289,18-Apr-18 12:31 AM,god bless,
saxon_dr#3806,18-Apr-18 12:31 AM,"oh, apparnelty it was just a spinning thinking emote",
saxon_dr#3806,18-Apr-18 12:31 AM,that's lame,
saxon_dr#3806,18-Apr-18 12:31 AM,it needs to be thonk or else it's not right :chewieREEE:,
Snowfish#4289,18-Apr-18 12:31 AM,not even a :Thonk_transparent: smh,
saxon_dr#3806,18-Apr-18 12:31 AM,:thonk:,
saxon_dr#3806,18-Apr-18 12:32 AM,apparently cs is like the only major where the girl to boy ratio is actually going down?,
saxon_dr#3806,18-Apr-18 12:32 AM,idk if that's still true but,
Snowfish#4289,18-Apr-18 12:32 AM,fuck if i know mate,
saxon_dr#3806,18-Apr-18 12:32 AM,if it is then there's some problems,
Snowfish#4289,18-Apr-18 12:32 AM,i try not to think about it,
Snowfish#4289,18-Apr-18 12:33 AM,"i do have to say though, i feel like faculty is a _little_ more hostile toward girls than guys",
saxon_dr#3806,18-Apr-18 12:33 AM,i read this book two years ago and that's what it said in the book,https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/402517390669381633/436021351631814656/51purrHHpgL.png
Snowfish#4289,18-Apr-18 12:33 AM,like every girl i've talked to in CS complains about it,
saxon_dr#3806,18-Apr-18 12:33 AM,i didn't actually went to verify it but,
saxon_dr#3806,18-Apr-18 12:33 AM,i'm guessing she did her research on that,
Snowfish#4289,18-Apr-18 12:33 AM,i can imagine it is,
IceF1ame#8123,18-Apr-18 12:33 AM,lol well it makes sense,
IceF1ame#8123,18-Apr-18 12:33 AM,guys tend to like cs more,
Snowfish#4289,18-Apr-18 12:33 AM,male-dominated fields are and always will be toxic as fuck,
saxon_dr#3806,18-Apr-18 12:33 AM,this book is actually really eye opening,
IceF1ame#8123,18-Apr-18 12:33 AM,the google manifesto thing literally used genetics to prove why cs appeals to guys,
saxon_dr#3806,18-Apr-18 12:34 AM,it talks about how the misogyny in science isn't necessarily that easy to notice for males,
Snowfish#4289,18-Apr-18 12:34 AM,aint that the truth :blobhyperthinkfast:,
saxon_dr#3806,18-Apr-18 12:35 AM,"like how girls aren't always being actively discouraged to pursue these things, they're just normally told to do other stuff or not encouraged as much as guys",
saxon_dr#3806,18-Apr-18 12:35 AM,amongst other things,
Snowfish#4289,18-Apr-18 12:35 AM,i'd wager its' more the fact that,
Snowfish#4289,18-Apr-18 12:35 AM,girls trying to do anything sciency always have these weird expectations,
Snowfish#4289,18-Apr-18 12:35 AM,like rather than just trying to learn something you're like,

Snowfish#4289,18-Apr-18 12:41 AM,there's always that one professor,
Snowfish#4289,18-Apr-18 12:41 AM,that does their hardest to make it impossible,
Snowfish#4289,18-Apr-18 12:41 AM,always.,
Snowfish#4289,18-Apr-18 12:41 AM,and its not even like the horror story shit you hear about,
Snowfish#4289,18-Apr-18 12:41 AM,it's just them being lazy,
saxon_dr#3806,18-Apr-18 12:41 AM,lmao,
Snowfish#4289,18-Apr-18 12:41 AM,"""yeah we'll have like 2 tests and maybe 4 homeworks and that's your entier grade, alright, good.""",
Snowfish#4289,18-Apr-18 12:41 AM,then before the test they give you some cryptic ass like,
saxon_dr#3806,18-Apr-18 12:41 AM,i guess i can't really complain about that with the pfp that i have,
Snowfish#4289,18-Apr-18 12:41 AM,"""yeah maybe a little bit of chapter 4 and eeeeh about half of chapter 5.""",
Snowfish#4289,18-Apr-18 12:42 AM,and that's all of your study material,
saxon_dr#3806,18-Apr-18 12:42 AM,so in that case do you just like talk to people that have taken the class b4 and ask them what kind of stuff you actually need to know?,
Snowfish#4289,18-Apr-18 12:43 AM,its never the same,
Snowfish#4289,18-Apr-18 12:43 AM,even the same professor teaches it completely differently the next semester,
Snowfish#4289,18-Apr-18 12:43 AM,you're just kinda fucked tbh,
saxon_dr#3806,18-Apr-18 12:43 AM,oh lol,
saxon_dr#3806,18-Apr-18 12:43 AM,i kinda assumed that if they're lazy they're not gonna be changing it up that much,
Snowfish#4289,18-Apr-18 12:44 AM,it's impressive at times,
Snowfish#4289,18-Apr-18 12:44 AM,"but yeah, it's relatively",
Snowfish#4289,18-Apr-18 12:44 AM,"and this is a strong, strong use of the word relatively",
Snowfish#4289,18-Apr-18 12:44 AM,simple to get a GPA in the high 3.x's,
Snowfish#4289,18-Apr-18 12:44 AM,if you put the time n,
Snowfish#4289,18-Apr-18 12:45 AM,to actually study and to the work,
Snowfish#4289,18-Apr-18 12:45 AM,but i'd say its borderline impossible to get a 4.0,
saxon_dr#3806,18-Apr-18 12:45 AM,yeah i need to work on that,
Snowfish#4289,18-Apr-18 12:45 AM,like you cant win em all,
saxon_dr#3806,18-Apr-18 12:45 AM,actually putting the time in,
Snowfish#4289,18-Apr-18 12:45 AM,well,
Snowfish#4289,18-Apr-18 12:45 AM,it's hard as fuck in college,
Snowfish#4289,18-Apr-18 12:45 AM,you'll have like a 12 PM class,
Snowfish#4289,18-Apr-18 12:45 AM,and you'll wake up at 11,
Snowfish#4289,18-Apr-18 12:45 AM,and it's kinda chilly outside,
saxon_dr#3806,18-Apr-18 12:45 AM,i'm totally expecting this to be a trial by fire kind of thing,
Snowfish#4289,18-Apr-18 12:45 AM,and you go like,
Snowfish#4289,18-Apr-18 12:45 AM,"""he doesnt tkae attendance""",
Snowfish#4289,18-Apr-18 12:45 AM,"""he posts notes online""",
Snowfish#4289,18-Apr-18 12:45 AM,then you to back to sleep,
saxon_dr#3806,18-Apr-18 12:46 AM,"at first i'm not used to having to work that hard, don't have study habits, etc",
saxon_dr#3806,18-Apr-18 12:46 AM,and then just slowly and kinda painfully adjusting,
Snowfish#4289,18-Apr-18 12:46 AM,accurate,
Snowfish#4289,18-Apr-18 12:46 AM,hardest part of college is the freedom,
Snowfish#4289,18-Apr-18 12:46 AM,nobody gives a shit if you miss like 10 classes in a row,
saxon_dr#3806,18-Apr-18 12:46 AM,lol i went to summer school during my sophomore,
saxon_dr#3806,18-Apr-18 12:46 AM,in the last week,

Snowfish#4289,18-Apr-18 12:47 AM,very rarely,
Snowfish#4289,18-Apr-18 12:47 AM,mostly just notes,
udishab#2211,18-Apr-18 12:47 AM,aww dang,
Snowfish#4289,18-Apr-18 12:47 AM,sometimes nothing,
Snowfish#4289,18-Apr-18 12:47 AM,my second semester though,
Snowfish#4289,18-Apr-18 12:47 AM,i have regrets bois,
saxon_dr#3806,18-Apr-18 12:48 AM,i know this is pretty stereotypical but there're a lot of things that i want changed once i get to college,
saxon_dr#3806,18-Apr-18 12:48 AM,"socialize more, study more, work harder, go to gym more, etc",
saxon_dr#3806,18-Apr-18 12:48 AM,i mean maybe it's like what you said i can't do 'em all but,
Snowfish#4289,18-Apr-18 12:48 AM,one at a time mate,
Snowfish#4289,18-Apr-18 12:48 AM,one at a time,
saxon_dr#3806,18-Apr-18 12:48 AM,yeah yeah,
Gadget246#0848,18-Apr-18 12:49 AM,"i never saw the appeal of skipping until i started having school trips that caused me to miss multiple days in a row, and i would come back and ask my teacher for makeup stuff, and they wouldn't have accomplished anything while i was gone that was worth making up, and I would just think ""so why exactly do I come to school again?""",
Snowfish#4289,18-Apr-18 12:49 AM,yup,
saxon_dr#3806,18-Apr-18 12:49 AM,i mean,

saxon_dr#3806,18-Apr-18 12:49 AM,high school pace is kinda troll,

Snowfish#4289,18-Apr-18 12:49 AM,i show up for tests and quizzes,
saxon_dr#3806,18-Apr-18 12:50 AM,there was one calc class where the whole class all they accomplished was going over homework problems that people didn't know how to do,
saxon_dr#3806,18-Apr-18 12:50 AM,and he only assigned like 15 problems to do...,
Snowfish#4289,18-Apr-18 12:50 AM,lmao,

Snowfish#4289,18-Apr-18 12:55 AM,expect to be lazy,
Snowfish#4289,18-Apr-18 12:55 AM,it's easier in the long run,
Snowfish#4289,18-Apr-18 12:55 AM,like if i go to bed like,

Snowfish#4289,18-Apr-18 12:55 AM,"""im totally gonna skip tomorrow""",

saxon_dr#3806,18-Apr-18 12:56 AM,:FeelsGoodMan:,
Snowfish#4289,18-Apr-18 12:56 AM,the way it went for me i was like,

Snowfish#4289,18-Apr-18 12:56 AM,then the next semester was,

Snowfish#4289,18-Apr-18 12:56 AM,then halfway through,

Snowfish#4289,18-Apr-18 12:57 AM,i was absolutely prepared for it though,

Snowfish#4289,18-Apr-18 12:58 AM,he's a silly goose though,

saxon_dr#3806,18-Apr-18 01:28 AM,that's my experience at boarding school anyway,
Snowfish#4289,18-Apr-18 01:28 AM,pff diplomacy,

Snowfish#4289,18-Apr-18 01:28 AM,i spent 18 years as the younger sibling,
Snowfish#4289,18-Apr-18 01:28 AM,i was well versed in guerrila warfare,
saxon_dr#3806,18-Apr-18 01:28 AM,"welp there was this one guy we just literally told each other, we are never gonna talk to each other again",
saxon_dr#3806,18-Apr-18 01:28 AM,sounds super petty but that's pretty much what we did,

Snowfish#4289,18-Apr-18 01:30 AM,warddrobe thing,
Snowfish#4289,18-Apr-18 01:30 AM,meaning it couldnt be opened cuz they'd block it,
Snowfish#4289,18-Apr-18 01:30 AM,so i'd climb up on top of hers and like,
Snowfish#4289,18-Apr-18 01:30 AM,wedge them behind it,
Snowfish#4289,18-Apr-18 01:30 AM,so she'd have to like,

Snowfish#4289,18-Apr-18 01:48 AM,then again all the league i ever played was,
Snowfish#4289,18-Apr-18 01:48 AM,"""snowfish support is super fun in league""",
Snowfish#4289,18-Apr-18 01:49 AM,and i bought into the lies becuase of runes or wahtever the fuck,

thedragonlegacy#2854,18-Apr-18 06:26 PM,Walmart near the Panda Express & QT? @Rye#0666,
Rye#0666,18-Apr-18 06:27 PM,Yeah but the truck was by Mori House and CVS,

Snowfish#4289,18-Apr-18 06:28 PM,i havent done this shit in like 4 years so im not sure if im stupid or not,
Snowfish#4289,18-Apr-18 06:28 PM,but,
Snowfish#4289,18-Apr-18 06:28 PM,log base 2 of 2^b/2^c is b - c,
Snowfish#4289,18-Apr-18 06:28 PM,yea? yea?,
Rye#0666,18-Apr-18 06:29 PM,I believe so,
Gadget246#0848,18-Apr-18 06:29 PM,yes,
waffle.dynasty#2740,18-Apr-18 06:29 PM,Sure,
Rye#0666,18-Apr-18 06:29 PM,Because 2^b/2^c simplifies to 2^b-c,
Snowfish#4289,18-Apr-18 06:29 PM,aite thanks bois,

Snowfish#4289,18-Apr-18 06:30 PM,lmao,
Snowfish#4289,18-Apr-18 06:30 PM,oh god pls,
Snowfish#4289,18-Apr-18 06:30 PM,no theyre just ints,
Snowfish#4289,18-Apr-18 06:30 PM,UNSIGNED ints,

Gadget246#0848,18-Apr-18 06:31 PM,"i'm not sure what you're saying is delicious andrew, unsigned ints or dummy limbs",
8726andrew#5709,18-Apr-18 06:31 PM,Yes,
Snowfish#4289,18-Apr-18 06:31 PM,definitely unsigned int,
mic#7575,18-Apr-18 06:45 PM,dafuq is an unsigned integer,
Snowfish#4289,18-Apr-18 06:46 PM,its an integer without a sign,
Snowfish#4289,18-Apr-18 06:46 PM,😄,
mic#7575,18-Apr-18 06:46 PM,isn’t that just a positive integer?,
Snowfish#4289,18-Apr-18 06:47 PM,well,
Snowfish#4289,18-Apr-18 06:47 PM,yes,
Chafos#1781,18-Apr-18 06:47 PM,it's a specific data type in several programming languages as well,
Snowfish#4289,18-Apr-18 06:47 PM,sorta,
Chafos#1781,18-Apr-18 06:47 PM,"like generally there's one bit reserved into indicate the sign of the integer, iirc",
Snowfish#4289,18-Apr-18 06:47 PM,signed ints are ints that are negative if their first bit is a 1,
Snowfish#4289,18-Apr-18 06:47 PM,2's complement,
Snowfish#4289,18-Apr-18 06:47 PM,etc,
Snowfish#4289,18-Apr-18 06:47 PM,unsigned ints are just generic binary,
mic#7575,18-Apr-18 06:48 PM,huh,
saxon_dr#3806,18-Apr-18 06:49 PM,yeah when you do certain calculations it matters if it's signed or unsigned,
saxon_dr#3806,18-Apr-18 06:49 PM,i think in some cases if the number is too big it goes around or something? and then that's different depending on if the int is signed,
Snowfish#4289,18-Apr-18 06:50 PM,if its too big it breaks,
saxon_dr#3806,18-Apr-18 06:50 PM,idk tho i've only read about this in the c++ book that i try to read from time to time and can never get through,
Snowfish#4289,18-Apr-18 06:50 PM,"it goes ""no stop it""",
Chafos#1781,18-Apr-18 06:50 PM,I thought it wrapped around,
Chafos#1781,18-Apr-18 06:50 PM,at least in java it does that,
Snowfish#4289,18-Apr-18 06:50 PM,it more of matters if you're going to be utilizing all of the bits in your word,
Snowfish#4289,18-Apr-18 06:50 PM,like,
Snowfish#4289,18-Apr-18 06:51 PM,if you have 8 bits and you want to go to up to 2^8,
Snowfish#4289,18-Apr-18 06:51 PM,its real important that its unsigned,
Snowfish#4289,18-Apr-18 06:51 PM,otherwise shit gets whacky,
saxon_dr#3806,18-Apr-18 06:51 PM,oh ok,
saxon_dr#3806,18-Apr-18 06:51 PM,i'm actually glad that we start off with basic java and python,
saxon_dr#3806,18-Apr-18 06:52 PM,my foundation is pretty shaky,
saxon_dr#3806,18-Apr-18 06:52 PM,since i never really had a real cs class,
Snowfish#4289,18-Apr-18 06:52 PM,C is just obnoxious,

Snowfish#4289,18-Apr-18 06:52 PM,its real nice but god its annoying,
Snowfish#4289,18-Apr-18 06:52 PM,i hate structs,
Chafos#1781,18-Apr-18 06:52 PM,c++ is still obnoxious imo,
Snowfish#4289,18-Apr-18 06:52 PM,theyre like the bane of my existence,

Chafos#1781,18-Apr-18 07:12 PM,just out of curiosity is this course required for all cs majors or is it for a specific thread,
Snowfish#4289,18-Apr-18 07:12 PM,it’s like 75% of threads,
Chafos#1781,18-Apr-18 07:12 PM,oh wow,

Chafos#1781,18-Apr-18 07:13 PM,I'm looking at the curriculum and it seems very intimidating to me lol,

Snowfish#4289,18-Apr-18 07:15 PM,lecture hall was completely jammed,
kk4jrq#5652,18-Apr-18 07:15 PM,Freedom!!,
Snowfish#4289,18-Apr-18 07:16 PM,trynna fit a 200 person class intoa. 150 lecture hall,
Snowfish#4289,18-Apr-18 07:16 PM,ama,
Snowfish#4289,18-Apr-18 07:16 PM,smh*,
Snowfish#4289,18-Apr-18 07:16 PM,anyway @Chafos#1781 ping me in like an hour i’m gonna go grab dinner so i won’t be at a pc,
Chafos#1781,18-Apr-18 07:16 PM,"aight cool, will do",
mic#7575,18-Apr-18 08:48 PM,what’s the name of the textbook?,
mic#7575,18-Apr-18 08:48 PM,also why do colleges have classes at 7?,
8726andrew#5709,18-Apr-18 08:48 PM,differs for every class,
8726andrew#5709,18-Apr-18 08:49 PM,because why not,
mic#7575,18-Apr-18 08:49 PM,the textbook Snowfish was referring to?,
Chafos#1781,18-Apr-18 08:50 PM,I would 100% do classes at 7,
mic#7575,18-Apr-18 08:50 PM,the idea of it is just so weird to me,
Chafos#1781,18-Apr-18 08:50 PM,I hate the fact that school starts so early,
Chafos#1781,18-Apr-18 08:51 PM,so any deviation from that unhealthy norm is a-ok by me,
mic#7575,18-Apr-18 08:51 PM,yeah it’s kinda messed up,
mic#7575,18-Apr-18 08:52 PM,btw does anyone else use Stack Exchange?,
Chafos#1781,18-Apr-18 08:52 PM,did you just invoke the name of our savior,
MEE6#4876,18-Apr-18 08:52 PM,"GG @Chafos#1781, you just advanced to level 14!",
mic#7575,18-Apr-18 08:52 PM,interpersonal.stackexchange.com is kinda sad,
mic#7575,18-Apr-18 08:52 PM,lol,
Chafos#1781,18-Apr-18 08:53 PM,haha I came across that one not too long ago,
mic#7575,18-Apr-18 08:53 PM,the Hot Network Questions thing is just so addicting,
Chafos#1781,18-Apr-18 08:53 PM,one of my favorite ones is codegolf.stackexchange.com,
mic#7575,18-Apr-18 08:55 PM,what’s your favorite thing about it?,
mic#7575,18-Apr-18 08:55 PM,I don’t really understand the stuff they write there unless it’s Python,
Chafos#1781,18-Apr-18 08:57 PM,"I just like the entire concept of coding golf.  There's all these obscure languages they make specifically for reducing the number of bytes needed to make a functional program, and it's also cool to see how people can make more notoriously robust languages like java work from time to time as well",
Chafos#1781,18-Apr-18 08:57 PM,one of the mods invented his own coding golf language and it wins for byte count on nearly every challenge it's used,
Chafos#1781,18-Apr-18 09:03 PM,I just stumbled upon this post and it completely blows my mind: https://codegolf.stackexchange.com/questions/88783/build-a-digital-clock-in-conways-game-of-life,
awesomebob333#6509,18-Apr-18 09:09 PM,that is one of the coolest things i have seen,
mic#7575,18-Apr-18 09:11 PM,hot dayum,
Gadget246#0848,18-Apr-18 09:56 PM,that's amazingly cool,
Gadget246#0848,18-Apr-18 09:57 PM,the way he hacked it together with logic circuits and brute-force timing reminds me of how i used to build things out of redstone in minecraft,
8726andrew#5709,18-Apr-18 09:57 PM,@mic#7575 my b I didn’t see that lol,
Gadget246#0848,18-Apr-18 09:58 PM,"so does the ""it doesn't matter how big it is. only the user interface matters"" mindset",
Gadget246#0848,18-Apr-18 10:01 PM,"example: ""No. It can't be a lever. It has to be a button.. Yes, I know that I want the input to toggle and stay toggled.. Yes, I know that's what levers do.. I'm going to make a button do that.""",
mic#7575,19-Apr-18 03:58 PM,if you put in your deposit do you get a Georgia Tech email address?,
Snowfish#4289,19-Apr-18 04:08 PM,i think if you can log into buzzport you already have an email address,

mic#7575,19-Apr-18 04:09 PM,hwat,
mic#7575,19-Apr-18 04:09 PM,I'll try that when I get home,
kk4jrq#5652,19-Apr-18 04:10 PM,Just tried... I have a login but it says I have no mailbox,
BradfordOfMars#9837,19-Apr-18 04:10 PM,I also don't have a mailbox,

BradfordOfMars#9837,19-Apr-18 04:12 PM,oh well mine is forwarded so that's why,
BradfordOfMars#9837,19-Apr-18 04:15 PM,login to passport and it has a bunch of email related stuff,
BradfordOfMars#9837,19-Apr-18 04:15 PM,https://passport.gatech.edu/email-preferences,
BradfordOfMars#9837,19-Apr-18 04:15 PM,you should be able to see your official school emails and customize them to your liking,
kk4jrq#5652,19-Apr-18 04:15 PM,Huh... Says I don't have access to email stuff,
BradfordOfMars#9837,19-Apr-18 04:22 PM,then maybe you don't have an email yet,
BradfordOfMars#9837,19-Apr-18 04:22 PM,idk,
kk4jrq#5652,19-Apr-18 04:22 PM,I guess not,
BradfordOfMars#9837,19-Apr-18 04:25 PM,It doesn't even give you the option to set one up following the instructions from the link that Lennox sent?,
saxon_dr#3806,19-Apr-18 04:25 PM,yeah i tried that b4 and don’t have one yet either,
BradfordOfMars#9837,19-Apr-18 04:26 PM,I guess you just have to keep waiting then,
BradfordOfMars#9837,19-Apr-18 04:27 PM,"I got mine as soon as I had a login, but my first year with gatech was through distance math so the circumstances were a little different",
Lennox#3038,19-Apr-18 04:27 PM,"^ same here, I just sent the faq link blindly hoping it'd work",
saxon_dr#3806,19-Apr-18 04:28 PM,i’ll try that when i get back i guess,
Lennox#3038,19-Apr-18 04:28 PM,"I do remember having to click a very specific ""request mailbox"" button though",
saxon_dr#3806,19-Apr-18 04:28 PM,but i think that the only ones that definitely have access and actually need them are the people doing summer programs,
saxon_dr#3806,19-Apr-18 04:28 PM,maybe the rest of us get our emails later,
BradfordOfMars#9837,19-Apr-18 04:30 PM,or maybe the system is just down for now,
BradfordOfMars#9837,19-Apr-18 04:30 PM,"I know that they're doing some updates which will be affecting the ""Student Information System""  this weekend starting at 5pm today",
Le Noir DragooN#8434,19-Apr-18 04:37 PM,Why r road bikes so expensive,
Le Noir DragooN#8434,19-Apr-18 04:50 PM,How much would you spend for a bike?,
mic#7575,19-Apr-18 04:59 PM,how much are they?,
mic#7575,19-Apr-18 04:59 PM,two hunna maybe,
Le Noir DragooN#8434,19-Apr-18 05:09 PM,"Yea under 500 it’s literally just a few that r good, and i don’t wanna drop more than 200 on a bike",
mic#7575,19-Apr-18 06:07 PM,I'm thinking I'd like a folding bike,
mic#7575,19-Apr-18 06:07 PM,like in Pokémon,
mic#7575,19-Apr-18 06:07 PM,but is the portability worth the smaller wheels?,
mic#7575,19-Apr-18 06:08 PM,can you bring normal bikes on airplanes?,
mic#7575,19-Apr-18 06:08 PM,or lock them up somewhere overnight so they won't get stolen?,
mic#7575,19-Apr-18 06:09 PM,or maybe a utility bicycle,
Le Noir DragooN#8434,19-Apr-18 06:17 PM,you may be able to wrap or somehow cover your bike firmly with a box and i think that could be checked in,
Le Noir DragooN#8434,19-Apr-18 06:18 PM,and Im leaning mountain or road bike,
Gadget246#0848,19-Apr-18 06:24 PM,i think you might ship your bike to wherever you're flying to rather than take it with you on the plane,
mic#7575,19-Apr-18 06:29 PM,yeah that might be better,
bopas2#1774,19-Apr-18 08:13 PM,"i thought i heard summer kids get their emails first and everyone else gets them later, i dunno",

saxon_dr#3806,21-Apr-18 07:53 PM,ooh i've heard that programming competitions are really fun,
saxon_dr#3806,21-Apr-18 07:53 PM,you don't have to download all kinds of packages and stuff cuz it's all preloaded there and you just spend a whole day solving problems,
thedragonlegacy#2854,21-Apr-18 07:56 PM,"basically solved a bunch of code problems for 2 and a half hours. Though we were provided free breakfast and pizza && it was goooood food. They had VR, AR, & 3d printing stuff for demo. Toured Lockheed Martin and saw parts of F-35s and C-130 planes being assembled",
thedragonlegacy#2854,21-Apr-18 07:56 PM,"nerd-tastic day, couldn’t ask for more",

Cleanfel#8596,21-Apr-18 08:56 PM,Saturdays always the chillest day,
Cleanfel#8596,21-Apr-18 08:56 PM,Also starting the marathon of seeing all marvel movies before infinity war,
Cleanfel#8596,21-Apr-18 08:56 PM,Should be fun,
Chafos#1781,21-Apr-18 09:03 PM,My friends are binging all the marvel movies over the course of like 48 hours.  They’re crazy lol,
Skfoos#9138,21-Apr-18 09:45 PM,"speaking of which, how recommended is it for someone to watch infinity war with little prior experience with marvel?",
Cleanfel#8596,21-Apr-18 09:53 PM,What other Marvel movies have you seen?,
MEE6#4876,21-Apr-18 09:53 PM,"GG @Cleanfel#8596, you just advanced to level 1!",
Cleanfel#8596,21-Apr-18 09:53 PM,I'm not a comic person and they're still great,
Skfoos#9138,21-Apr-18 09:57 PM,spider man homecoming and thor ragnarok,

Cleanfel#8596,21-Apr-18 10:00 PM,I getcha,
Cleanfel#8596,21-Apr-18 10:00 PM,I think watching it without anything else would still be good,
Cleanfel#8596,21-Apr-18 10:00 PM,"But if you want context would suggest you watch Iron Man, Captain America (1,2,3), First Avengers, Guardians of the Galaxy 1, Doctor Strange at the minimum",
Skfoos#9138,21-Apr-18 10:01 PM,yea i'd just not get the references to other movies,
Skfoos#9138,21-Apr-18 10:01 PM,that's a lot of movies,
Cleanfel#8596,21-Apr-18 10:01 PM,Yeah haha,
Skfoos#9138,21-Apr-18 10:01 PM,is there a reason you didn't include age of ultron?,
Cleanfel#8596,21-Apr-18 10:03 PM,"Uhh Age of Ultron wasn't *too* big, it just continued the story a little more. I'd probably recommend that one too if you have time lol",
Skfoos#9138,21-Apr-18 10:04 PM,oh fwiw i saw black panther too,
Cleanfel#8596,21-Apr-18 10:04 PM,Ah thats good,

Chafos#1781,22-Apr-18 07:26 PM,well I mean you probably get money,
Chafos#1781,22-Apr-18 07:26 PM,which is always a benefit,
Snowfish#4289,22-Apr-18 07:39 PM,some jobs give you tuition waivers ubt i dont think its the bookstore or cafeteria,
Snowfish#4289,22-Apr-18 07:39 PM,i think that's like TAing,
Devaansh#4240,22-Apr-18 09:33 PM,So if you have Zell,
Devaansh#4240,22-Apr-18 09:33 PM,is tuition double free or something,
8726andrew#5709,22-Apr-18 09:33 PM,?,
8726andrew#5709,22-Apr-18 09:33 PM,hope is only 85%,
Devaansh#4240,22-Apr-18 09:33 PM,Zell + TAing,
8726andrew#5709,22-Apr-18 09:33 PM,oh,
8726andrew#5709,22-Apr-18 09:34 PM,i mean maybe they'd do housing or something,

themroats#3435,23-Apr-18 02:42 AM,Oof,
8726andrew#5709,23-Apr-18 06:55 AM,It’s kinda raining everywhere so have fun,
kk4jrq#5652,23-Apr-18 07:02 AM,Just Dodge the raindrops.  It's simple,
Rye#0666,23-Apr-18 07:10 AM,Bring an umbrella and pray you don't get wet,
Rye#0666,23-Apr-18 07:10 AM,:papabless:,
Cleanfel#8596,23-Apr-18 10:45 AM,It's just slightly acidic water,
kk4jrq#5652,23-Apr-18 03:08 PM,You'll only melt a little... Think of it as a quick weight loss program,
IceF1ame#8123,23-Apr-18 05:26 PM,how much does it usually rain in atlanta during fallwinterspring?,
supremeavenger#3061,23-Apr-18 06:03 PM,depends,
supremeavenger#3061,23-Apr-18 06:03 PM,georgia weather is extremely bipolar,
kk4jrq#5652,23-Apr-18 06:08 PM,We could have a ton of rain or be completely dry... You just never know,
Cleanfel#8596,23-Apr-18 06:09 PM,Just always be prepared,
Snowfish#4289,23-Apr-18 06:09 PM,the amount of times ive been rained on on campus is actually kind of pathetic,
Snowfish#4289,23-Apr-18 06:09 PM,get a small umbrella bois,
Snowfish#4289,23-Apr-18 06:09 PM,:PepeHands:,
8726andrew#5709,23-Apr-18 06:56 PM,pack pretty much all clothes possible year round,
8726andrew#5709,23-Apr-18 06:57 PM,spring can mean 60 all day or 30 in the morning and 40 in the afternoon,
8726andrew#5709,23-Apr-18 06:57 PM,you never really know,
Chafos#1781,23-Apr-18 06:59 PM,shit I thought I was leaving 30 degrees back in the northeast,
Chafos#1781,23-Apr-18 06:59 PM,guess not,
8726andrew#5709,23-Apr-18 06:59 PM,hahaha,
8726andrew#5709,23-Apr-18 06:59 PM,this winter in december it was like a high of 30 for like a solid 2 weeks,
8726andrew#5709,23-Apr-18 06:59 PM,well last december whatever,
Snowfish#4289,23-Apr-18 08:59 PM,its more like,
Snowfish#4289,23-Apr-18 08:59 PM,"spring means one day will be 45 with rain, then the literal next day will be 80 degrees with blazing sun",
SamH747#8624,23-Apr-18 09:14 PM,But das how we like it,
Gadget246#0848,23-Apr-18 09:18 PM,@current students or anyone with information -- What do you think of having a desktop in the dorm and carrying around a chromebook which can remote control it instead of carrying around a normal laptop?,
Gadget246#0848,23-Apr-18 09:20 PM,"desktops are generally better long term investments and carrying around a cheap, lightweight chromebook seems preferable to carrying around an expensive, heavy laptop to me, but it's not technically within the posted laptop requirements",
Gadget246#0848,23-Apr-18 09:21 PM,"also, any idea who I'd need to ask to get official permission to go outside of the posted laptop requirements? (just asking you guys if you think it might work, I'll get official permission before actually doing anything wacky like that)",
kk4jrq#5652,23-Apr-18 09:23 PM,You'd probably be fine until GT WiFi doesn't work.,
Gadget246#0848,23-Apr-18 09:25 PM,is that a normal occurrence? I could use a hotspot every once in a while if wifi only rarely doesn't work,
kk4jrq#5652,23-Apr-18 09:41 PM,I have no clue...,
kk4jrq#5652,23-Apr-18 09:42 PM,Personally I wouldn't rely on remote desktop entirely... I'd at least get a half decent laptop...,
kk4jrq#5652,23-Apr-18 09:42 PM,But I totally agree investing more in a desktop is a great idea,
Thedarkbobman#8576,23-Apr-18 09:42 PM,^,
Thedarkbobman#8576,23-Apr-18 09:43 PM,desktops are great but it helps to have a decent laptop as well,
Cleanfel#8596,23-Apr-18 09:46 PM,That's probably what I planned to do with my desktop,
MEE6#4876,23-Apr-18 09:46 PM,"GG @Cleanfel#8596, you just advanced to level 2!",
mic#7575,23-Apr-18 09:47 PM,Remote Desktop is slowwww in my experience,
saxon_dr#3806,23-Apr-18 10:59 PM,i've heard of some service for gaming that's essentially remote desktop,
saxon_dr#3806,23-Apr-18 10:59 PM,like they hook you up to a good pc and you can paly on a shitty laptop through the software,
saxon_dr#3806,23-Apr-18 10:59 PM,if that actually does work i imagine it doesn't lag that much since it's supposed to work for gaming,
saxon_dr#3806,23-Apr-18 11:00 PM,but i don't remember what that service is called or how well it works,
saxon_dr#3806,23-Apr-18 11:00 PM,might wanna try googling it if you're interested,
Mocha#8744,23-Apr-18 11:01 PM,I've used a program called Parsec before and it works pretty well,
Mocha#8744,23-Apr-18 11:01 PM,for streaming your pc to a laptop,
saxon_dr#3806,23-Apr-18 11:07 PM,i still need to take my laptop to the shop one day,

Quantum#1480,24-Apr-18 12:05 AM,A couple of my friends got into the beta for GeForce Now,

Caw#1913,24-Apr-18 12:08 AM,@saxon_dr#3806 The one I've used is called Parsec,
Caw#1913,24-Apr-18 12:08 AM,And it works pretty good,
Caw#1913,24-Apr-18 12:08 AM,We once had 5 people controlling one person in a rainbow six siege game,
saxon_dr#3806,24-Apr-18 12:10 AM,lol that sounds like twitch plays,
saxon_dr#3806,24-Apr-18 12:10 AM,you know those things where chat types in commands and the bot plays the game according to that,
Caw#1913,24-Apr-18 12:11 AM,oh yah,
Caw#1913,24-Apr-18 12:11 AM,It kinda is,
Caw#1913,24-Apr-18 12:11 AM,But it can be used for streaming games or playing local coop games,
saxon_dr#3806,24-Apr-18 12:24 AM,hmm true,
saxon_dr#3806,24-Apr-18 12:25 AM,maybe it could be a better option than having a duo pc set up,
saxon_dr#3806,24-Apr-18 12:25 AM,for streamers that is,
kk4jrq#5652,24-Apr-18 09:27 AM,I used to really want GeForce Now.... But then I got a laptop with a GTX 1070 so I can play games all the time.,

saxon_dr#3806,24-Apr-18 12:13 PM,yeah i do that here at boarding school all the time,
saxon_dr#3806,24-Apr-18 12:14 PM,well not snacks but long term stuff like ramen,
joazlazer#2041,24-Apr-18 12:16 PM,"im just so confused why anyone would buy anything from the ""bulk sale"" then",
bakerman#1672,24-Apr-18 12:26 PM,I’m gonna buy from the bulk sale,
bakerman#1672,24-Apr-18 12:26 PM,I would be losing swipes if I didn’t,
Snowfish#4289,24-Apr-18 12:46 PM,yeah you can obviously buy off amazon but swipes go away at the end of spring,

R1CHY#1450,24-Apr-18 05:29 PM,Lol i was think about that 2,
Snowfish#4289,24-Apr-18 05:29 PM,"usually if you get an ipad and it's obviously laying on the table in front of you being used as notes, they wont get pissed",

saxon_dr#3806,24-Apr-18 05:29 PM,ok nice,

Snowfish#4289,24-Apr-18 05:38 PM,it’s pretty much across campus,
Gadget246#0848,24-Apr-18 06:26 PM,"there are minimum system requirements for the laptops, which is what i was talking about, a chromebook wouldn't fit those requirements, so i'd need to get permission if my plan is to use a remote desktop from a chromebook",

Chafos#1781,24-Apr-18 10:46 PM,lol I had to wait an hour and a half for my room to be ready when I went down on Sunday,
Chafos#1781,24-Apr-18 10:46 PM,probably the only instance during my visit in which southern hospitality was not expressed,
8726andrew#5709,24-Apr-18 10:46 PM,Lol southern hospitality,
8726andrew#5709,24-Apr-18 10:46 PM,That’s downtown Atlanta not the south,
Chafos#1781,24-Apr-18 10:47 PM,is downtown Atlanta not considered part of the south,
8726andrew#5709,24-Apr-18 10:47 PM,I mean Florida isn’t for sure,
8726andrew#5709,24-Apr-18 10:48 PM,Downtown Atlanta just isn’t very representative of the rest of the region,
Chafos#1781,24-Apr-18 10:48 PM,o gotcha,
Chafos#1781,24-Apr-18 10:48 PM,I’m from Maryland so everything South Carolina down and west kinda seems like the south to me,
8726andrew#5709,24-Apr-18 10:48 PM,The traffic doesn’t get better though,
8726andrew#5709,24-Apr-18 10:48 PM,Lmao nice,
Chafos#1781,24-Apr-18 10:49 PM,yeah I’ve heard the traffic sucks,
Chafos#1781,24-Apr-18 10:49 PM,although DC traffic is pretty bad too,
8726andrew#5709,24-Apr-18 10:49 PM,Yeah dc is pretty nasty,
Chafos#1781,24-Apr-18 10:58 PM,I drive to school in Baltimore though so that traffic’s not as bad,
Chafos#1781,24-Apr-18 10:58 PM,otherwise I wouldn’t be able to go 20 miles over the speed limit to get to school on time,
IceF1ame#8123,24-Apr-18 11:04 PM,yea I havent seen the south stereotype yet,
IceF1ame#8123,24-Apr-18 11:04 PM,I assume atlanta is a liberal bubble in georgia lol,
saxon_dr#3806,24-Apr-18 11:21 PM,the georgians in my school say that atlanta isn't georgia,

IceF1ame#8123,25-Apr-18 12:21 AM,bc of how northern and southern cultures differ,
IceF1ame#8123,25-Apr-18 12:22 AM,urban areas = more liberal = more northern,
saxon_dr#3806,25-Apr-18 01:07 AM,i mean i've only been there once so idk what exactly is different about atlanta from the rest of georgia,
saxon_dr#3806,25-Apr-18 01:07 AM,and i'm not saying that this statement is accurate,
saxon_dr#3806,25-Apr-18 01:07 AM,it's just something that i hear people saying,
Snowfish#4289,25-Apr-18 01:12 AM,it's a city so it's super liberal and diverse,
Snowfish#4289,25-Apr-18 01:12 AM,the rest of georgia is super conservative and white,
saxon_dr#3806,25-Apr-18 01:20 AM,well that's good,
Cole#0059,25-Apr-18 02:24 AM,hm... I mean I'm not even from Georgia... so I guess i really don't know what to expect in general,

Tempelina#0898,25-Apr-18 06:58 AM,"I’ve been living in Atlanta all my life and my cousins live in rural GA, so at your service! Atlanta is definitely much more liberal than the rest of GA, and it kinda resembles a bubble of sorts, but the change only happens slowly as you travel outside of its borders. Like an adjacent county would be a lot less conservative that somewhere two hours away",
Tempelina#0898,25-Apr-18 06:58 AM,"But yeah, *don’t underestimate the traffic*",
Tempelina#0898,25-Apr-18 06:59 AM,Rush hour is from like 4pm-8pm here and the highways are pretty much always clogged,
MEE6#4876,25-Apr-18 06:59 AM,"GG @Tempelina#0898, you just advanced to level 7!",
Tempelina#0898,25-Apr-18 06:59 AM,But we’ll be in a secluded campus so you only have to get into that if you want to,
8726andrew#5709,25-Apr-18 07:00 AM,Even in suburbia where I live rush hour is still hella awful,
Tempelina#0898,25-Apr-18 07:02 AM,I went to visit some friends on Sunday in Gwinnett and lord those 3-lane roads are horrible,

Vivacia#0193,25-Apr-18 10:11 AM,does joining the LCC programs really help?,
Tempelina#0898,25-Apr-18 10:12 AM,It depends on what you’re like and what you’re looking for as far as the College experience goes,
Tempelina#0898,25-Apr-18 10:12 AM,Did you get accepted into one?,
Vivacia#0193,25-Apr-18 10:12 AM,I didn't apply,
Vivacia#0193,25-Apr-18 10:12 AM,Figured I'd let my first year go a little easier,
Vivacia#0193,25-Apr-18 10:12 AM,"If I were to join one though, I'd choose GC",
Tempelina#0898,25-Apr-18 10:13 AM,"Well I’m pretty sure you’ve missed your opportunity for this year haha, but maybe you can do one next year?",
Vivacia#0193,25-Apr-18 10:13 AM,"Yeah, thinking about doing it from next year",
Vivacia#0193,25-Apr-18 10:13 AM,but does it help?,
Tempelina#0898,25-Apr-18 10:14 AM,I don’t know much about GC specifically but it’ll only help you if you want a close knit community where you’re in classes with all of your dorm mates and you don’t have to interact with the outside world if you don’t want to,
Tempelina#0898,25-Apr-18 10:14 AM,"It’s kinda like a bubble, but you don’t have to restrict yourself to that bubble",
Vivacia#0193,25-Apr-18 10:15 AM,"ah, sounds like a cozy cocoon",
MEE6#4876,25-Apr-18 10:15 AM,"GG @Vivacia#0193, you just advanced to level 1!",

IceF1ame#8123,25-Apr-18 01:20 PM,is GT’s avg grad rate 5 years?,
mic#7575,25-Apr-18 01:32 PM,hwat,
Chafos#1781,25-Apr-18 03:13 PM,I hope not.  I was fully intending to graduate in 4 years lol,
Chafos#1781,25-Apr-18 03:13 PM,I should get a crap ton of credit and then an extra semester would allow me to take enough classes to complete a minor,
IceF1ame#8123,25-Apr-18 05:35 PM,they said that most take co ops,
IceF1ame#8123,25-Apr-18 05:35 PM,and grad in 5 yrs since they do an internship during the year,
IceF1ame#8123,25-Apr-18 05:35 PM,I’m not sure if those are the correct stats tho,
IceF1ame#8123,25-Apr-18 05:35 PM,gt senpais plz help,
Chafos#1781,25-Apr-18 05:42 PM,"The whole co op thing seems bizarre to me, I would honestly just do summer internships tbh",
IceF1ame#8123,25-Apr-18 06:37 PM,^^,
IceF1ame#8123,25-Apr-18 06:37 PM,or at least work part time,
themroats#3435,25-Apr-18 06:37 PM,They said a lot of people don’t graduate in 4 but that’s because they have internships and stuff. From what I can tell when that happens you only pay 8 semesters of tuition it just might be a bit longer with time off due to internships,
Chafos#1781,25-Apr-18 06:39 PM,"most internships are over the summer tho, which wouldn't interfere with graduating on time",
Chafos#1781,25-Apr-18 06:39 PM,it must be the co-ops if the graduation time is truly that much delayed,
8726andrew#5709,25-Apr-18 06:46 PM,its like 30-40 % of people take more than 4 or something like that,
8726andrew#5709,25-Apr-18 06:46 PM,which is a combo of internships and coops and stem majors being silly,
Chafos#1781,25-Apr-18 06:52 PM,holy crap didn't realize it was that high lol,
Chafos#1781,25-Apr-18 06:53 PM,I know I'm not doing more than 3 because summer after freshman year imma do study abroad,
IceF1ame#8123,25-Apr-18 06:59 PM,hahaha rip I’m gonna try getting an internship over summer freshie yr,
IceF1ame#8123,25-Apr-18 06:59 PM,its gonna be a struggle,

thedragonlegacy#2854,28-Apr-18 03:00 PM,¯\_(ツ)_/¯,
thedragonlegacy#2854,28-Apr-18 03:01 PM,you would think that there'd be some sort of commitment thing w/ a frat,
Thedarkbobman#8576,28-Apr-18 03:02 PM,did scholarships come out yet?,
Chafos#1781,28-Apr-18 03:28 PM,lol I personally wouldn’t join a frat regardless but if you want go for it,
8726andrew#5709,28-Apr-18 03:29 PM,Yeah I’d imagine if you joined one they wouldn’t let you leave so easily,
thedragonlegacy#2854,28-Apr-18 03:50 PM,scholarships for..? @Thedarkbobman#8576,
Thedarkbobman#8576,28-Apr-18 03:50 PM,dont they have general scholarships as a part of the fin aid,
Thedarkbobman#8576,28-Apr-18 03:50 PM,i may be wrong about that tho,
thedragonlegacy#2854,28-Apr-18 03:53 PM,those scholarships would've already been factored into the financial award letter,
thedragonlegacy#2854,28-Apr-18 03:54 PM,"and if you get outside scholarships, you need to email their finaid revision squad about the additional $$",
thedragonlegacy#2854,28-Apr-18 03:55 PM,i believe they start finaid award letter revisions for special circumstances in may,
Thedarkbobman#8576,28-Apr-18 03:59 PM,ok thx,
thedragonlegacy#2854,28-Apr-18 04:19 PM,"also if you guys haven't looked into student health insurance, it costs (1st sem) $773 + (2nd sem) $1083. If you're already covered by another insurance company, you're good, you just need to fill out a waiver.",
mic#7575,28-Apr-18 04:25 PM,lol okay,
mic#7575,28-Apr-18 04:37 PM,why are things more expensive second sem,
supremeavenger#3061,28-Apr-18 04:49 PM,more likely to be reckless after having become comfortable with the campus probably @mic#7575,
Lennox#3038,28-Apr-18 04:57 PM,plus that's when grad students are allowed to begin... experimentation,

Snowfish#4289,28-Apr-18 07:16 PM,ive never spent money on textbooks,
Snowfish#4289,28-Apr-18 07:16 PM,"just gotta know where to find the ""legal free copies"" 😉",
Snowfish#4289,28-Apr-18 07:16 PM,i probably spend like $150 between my first two years on like,
Snowfish#4289,28-Apr-18 07:16 PM,online passes and stuff tho,
Snowfish#4289,28-Apr-18 07:16 PM,like webassign and stuff,

thedragonlegacy#2854,28-Apr-18 07:18 PM,;p,

Snowfish#4289,28-Apr-18 07:22 PM,esp if you're in one of the dorms that's like right on top of the dining halls,
Snowfish#4289,28-Apr-18 07:23 PM,although i think they did away with the unlimited meal swipe plans now that they opened west village,
thedragonlegacy#2854,28-Apr-18 07:23 PM,"yeah, i think so too",

Snowfish#4289,28-Apr-18 07:24 PM,but its not that bad,
Snowfish#4289,28-Apr-18 07:24 PM,otherwise classes are just included in your tuition obv,

Snowfish#4289,28-Apr-18 07:25 PM,and i had AP ES credit so it satisfied the sequence thing for CS,

Caw#1913,30-Apr-18 09:42 PM,Okay by residency does it have to be a period of 12 months without me being at GT? My dad has an opportunity to transfer to a new position in his company that is in Georgia and thought that would get us instate after a year,
IceF1ame#8123,30-Apr-18 10:05 PM,why would u guys move just to get instate tuition?,

saxon_dr#3806,02-May-18 06:17 PM,well the first T is definitely not enunciated imo,
saxon_dr#3806,02-May-18 06:17 PM,when people say at they don't enunciate the T either,
Gadget246#0848,02-May-18 06:17 PM,"@8726andrew#5709 if i'm just saying the name atlanta i'd definitely enunciate the second T, but when i'm speaking quickly I drop it at least half the time, and people with a drawl probably drop it more",

8726andrew#5709,02-May-18 06:17 PM,That’s more southern GA and like Elijay levels of north,

8726andrew#5709,02-May-18 06:18 PM,I’m acting like I know what I’m saying but the more I say the more I’m wrong so I don’t know anymore,

bu#7175,02-May-18 06:18 PM,I grew up in a ghetto so its probably the exception not the rule,
bu#7175,02-May-18 06:18 PM,we dont even pronounce our city's name right lmaoo,

Gadget246#0848,02-May-18 06:23 PM,"people from where i live (outside the perimeter) would pronounce it Tren'n, and we use glottal stops for pretty much any T that's at the end of a syllable",

bu#7175,02-May-18 06:24 PM,oh dope,
bu#7175,02-May-18 06:24 PM,lol i dont know what they are either so youre fine,
Gadget246#0848,02-May-18 06:24 PM,glottal stops are in the throat and what we do is with the tongue,

Tempelina#0898,03-May-18 10:45 PM,But has less coordination,
brumeux#4293,03-May-18 10:46 PM,wouldnt it be a weird muscle rotating to the side though,

kk4jrq#5652,03-May-18 10:48 PM,@Gadget246#0848 yeah they have your overall BC score but there is also an AB subscore.  They are each treated as though your took then as separate exams even if you just took BC,

Chafos#1781,03-May-18 11:17 PM,gotcha,
pnw#8833,03-May-18 11:18 PM,difference is like 80k but Washington doesn't gaurtenee incoming freshmen their major so  was a risky move,

Gadget246#0848,03-May-18 11:21 PM,yeah with in state plus zell it was going to be virtually impossible for any other school to convince me not to go to tech,
brumeux#4293,03-May-18 11:21 PM,zell is delicious money money,
Thedarkbobman#8576,03-May-18 11:21 PM,shoutout to the PA state schools for making the decision easy,
Thedarkbobman#8576,03-May-18 11:21 PM,our state school system is so bad people think state affiliated schools are the actual state ones,
pnw#8833,03-May-18 11:22 PM,anatnt r u paying like 42k a year,
Thedarkbobman#8576,03-May-18 11:22 PM,i think its like 50 but yeah,
pnw#8833,03-May-18 11:23 PM,yea it's so high wtf,
Thedarkbobman#8576,03-May-18 11:23 PM,eh its high but some of the other schools i was looking at were higher,
pnw#8833,03-May-18 11:23 PM,i got like some finacial grant for around 8k,
Thedarkbobman#8576,03-May-18 11:23 PM,thats cool,

Thedarkbobman#8576,03-May-18 11:24 PM,my parents actually thought it was a scam lmao,
Thedarkbobman#8576,03-May-18 11:24 PM,i had to tell them not to disregard it or whatever,
Chafos#1781,03-May-18 11:29 PM,what the hell,
Chafos#1781,03-May-18 11:30 PM,tech apparently updated their financial aid thing and apparently now they are giving me 0 aid whatsoever,
Chafos#1781,03-May-18 11:30 PM,thought that the update was gonna be a good thing :/,
pnw#8833,03-May-18 11:30 PM,That's so dumb,
pnw#8833,03-May-18 11:30 PM,how can they do that after u commit,
Chafos#1781,03-May-18 11:31 PM,"""The Board of Regents of the University System of Georgia has approved the tuition, mandatory fees, housing and meal plan costs for the upcoming 2018-2019 Aid Year. We have updated the 2018-2019 Standard Cost of Attendance (COA) to reflect these final figures.""",
Chafos#1781,03-May-18 11:31 PM,i guess that's their bullshit justification,
pnw#8833,03-May-18 11:32 PM,wait so is everyone going to get this change,
pnw#8833,03-May-18 11:32 PM,was it an email?,
Chafos#1781,03-May-18 11:32 PM,maybe,
Chafos#1781,03-May-18 11:32 PM,but it's still bs,
pnw#8833,03-May-18 11:32 PM,hold up,
pnw#8833,03-May-18 11:32 PM,I dont see a change,
Thedarkbobman#8576,03-May-18 11:33 PM,so how much is the cost of attendance this year,
Chafos#1781,03-May-18 11:33 PM,"according to my letter it's $48,964.00",
pnw#8833,03-May-18 11:33 PM,@Chafos#1781  did u get an email,
Chafos#1781,03-May-18 11:33 PM,yes,

pnw#8833,03-May-18 11:35 PM,do yall think ima be disadvantaged if i wana work in like the west coast with a degree from tech,
Chafos#1781,03-May-18 11:35 PM,no,
Chafos#1781,03-May-18 11:36 PM,it's my understanding that a tech degree is respected all over; I just went to a scholarship dinner tonight and talked with several people who work for high-end intelligence companies and I heard several times that the employees they hire that graduate from tech are some of the best at their companies,
Chafos#1781,03-May-18 11:37 PM,i live in md but still a bit removed from the atlanta area to prove the point,

thedragonlegacy#2854,06-May-18 12:37 AM,Lmao FASET is required & it costs $215.,
FinitePeach#1792,06-May-18 01:30 AM,Well you can skip you just won't get classes,
Rye#0666,06-May-18 01:38 AM,Can't tank your GPA down if you don't take classes,
Cole#0059,06-May-18 02:30 AM,"wait, so is it like bad to join FASET 6 or 7... i mean will most of the classes be filled up by then?",
FinitePeach#1792,06-May-18 02:30 AM,They reserve seats for later fasets,
Cole#0059,06-May-18 02:30 AM,oh really?,
Cole#0059,06-May-18 02:30 AM,thats nice,
FinitePeach#1792,06-May-18 02:31 AM,Still no guarantees but hey,
Rye#0666,06-May-18 10:38 AM,I heard that you only register for select classes at FASET,
Arya201#6452,06-May-18 12:03 PM,When is our orientation?,
Rye#0666,06-May-18 12:09 PM,There are multiple dates,
Rye#0666,06-May-18 12:09 PM,Depends on when you sign up,
Rye#0666,06-May-18 12:09 PM,I'm probably going to sign up for the last date,
saxon_dr#3806,06-May-18 12:12 PM,huh so since i'm going back home to china over the summer i would kinda have to choose the 6 and 7,
saxon_dr#3806,06-May-18 12:12 PM,but it sounds like i won't be late to register certain classes if i choose those?,
Arya201#6452,06-May-18 12:13 PM,I think id select 12th 13th,
saxon_dr#3806,06-May-18 12:14 PM,wait so if i choose 14-15th,
saxon_dr#3806,06-May-18 12:14 PM,can i just stay on campus afterwards or do i have to stay in a hotel,
saxon_dr#3806,06-May-18 12:15 PM,we move in on the 22nd right?,
Arya201#6452,06-May-18 12:15 PM,17th,
Arya201#6452,06-May-18 12:15 PM,Move in on the 17th,
Arya201#6452,06-May-18 12:15 PM,And pay 75$ per night if you move in earlier,
saxon_dr#3806,06-May-18 12:15 PM,oh ok then even if i do have to stay in a hotel that won't be that bad i guess,
Arya201#6452,06-May-18 12:15 PM,Yeah possibly,
Arya201#6452,06-May-18 12:15 PM,Havent been to the states before lol,
saxon_dr#3806,06-May-18 12:16 PM,oh well $75 definitely is cheaper than hotel,
Arya201#6452,06-May-18 12:16 PM,Idek how things work there,
Arya201#6452,06-May-18 12:17 PM,Oh no i have been there 🤔🤔,

Arya201#6452,06-May-18 12:17 PM,🤔🤔,
brumeux#4293,06-May-18 12:47 PM,i think we stay in dorms during faset,
brumeux#4293,06-May-18 12:48 PM,& yeah apparently no one gets the classes they need during faset phase I but it all works out in phase II,

Lennox#3038,06-May-18 01:48 PM,I think you can still register for the ones before that,
saxon_dr#3806,06-May-18 01:48 PM,wait milad,

saxon_dr#3806,06-May-18 01:49 PM,and it says those are prioritized for people living 800+ miles away,
saxon_dr#3806,06-May-18 01:49 PM,shanghai is definitely 800 miles away,

saxon_dr#3806,06-May-18 01:57 PM,well i'm only there like twice a year so,
Rye#0666,06-May-18 02:17 PM,@saxon_dr#3806 I'm in a similar situation. Will be in LA with my dad during the summer. Going to the FASET date on the 12th-13th of August probably,
saxon_dr#3806,06-May-18 02:35 PM,out of curiosity does 6 have any advantage over 7?,
saxon_dr#3806,06-May-18 02:35 PM,is it like there are courses reserved for both session together (which would mean that six is better than seven) or reserved for each individual session (in which case it's the same),
Rye#0666,06-May-18 02:37 PM,I think they have spots reserved per session,
Rye#0666,06-May-18 02:37 PM,At least from what I heard,
Rye#0666,06-May-18 02:37 PM,Like it shouldn't matter which session you go to. They have a set number of spots reserved per session for a given class,
saxon_dr#3806,06-May-18 02:39 PM,oh ok,
Gadget246#0848,06-May-18 08:47 PM,"@brumeux#4293 I'm not doing the first, sixth, or seventh FASET, but other than that idk yet. you?",

Lennox#3038,06-May-18 09:26 PM,"maybe, julian",

saxon_dr#3806,06-May-18 09:28 PM,oh did you already ask someone,
udishab#2211,06-May-18 09:29 PM,@thedragonlegacy#2854 we could make a faset channel to talk about this stuff maybe?,

udishab#2211,06-May-18 09:29 PM,ohhh haha you right 😂,
thedragonlegacy#2854,06-May-18 09:29 PM,i'll probably do a survey on #announcements  for FASET dates once registration begins,
thedragonlegacy#2854,06-May-18 09:31 PM,"just in case ppl want to know who else is going to their specific FASET date & meet up, ig",

saxon_dr#3806,06-May-18 09:40 PM,ooh ok,

Lennox#3038,06-May-18 09:51 PM,and I live within walking distance of the school itself,
thedragonlegacy#2854,06-May-18 09:52 PM,oh ya all of GCPS is at infinite energy center,

brumeux#4293,06-May-18 10:14 PM,i actually have no idea @Gadget246#0848 is it 400?,
Gadget246#0848,06-May-18 10:14 PM,"i don't think it's quite that big, the school is like 1700 people but our class is the smallest",
Chafos#1781,06-May-18 10:15 PM,"I just thought it was interesting you guys had it at a convention center, wasn't sure if you had a really big class or something",
Chafos#1781,06-May-18 10:15 PM,but your guys' school isn't overwhelmingly bigger than mine,
Chafos#1781,06-May-18 10:16 PM,my graduating class is about 200-220 and we have about 800-900 students total,
Gadget246#0848,06-May-18 10:44 PM,"they're having graduations there all day, our school just reserved one of the time slots",
Chafos#1781,06-May-18 10:49 PM,oh ok that makes sense,

themoosegoose#5243,07-May-18 08:45 AM,Asking any current freshmen,
themoosegoose#5243,07-May-18 08:45 AM,How many extraneous electives do we have to take besides actual major,

Cole#0059,07-May-18 11:11 AM,the CS major doesn't show any specific classes that people are required to take for some reason,
Snowfish#4289,07-May-18 11:13 AM,it’s based on what two threads you take,
saxon_dr#3806,07-May-18 11:17 AM,i know you said that advisors aren't that helpful but can i at least talk to them about choosing the threads?,
saxon_dr#3806,07-May-18 11:17 AM,i know i want intelligence to be my main one but not really sure which one to choose for secondary atm,

themoosegoose#5243,07-May-18 11:33 AM,I completed FAFSA,
themoosegoose#5243,07-May-18 11:34 AM,But what else are you supposed to do,
FinitePeach#1792,07-May-18 12:44 PM,So if you're instate you need either FAFSA or GSFAPPS  (something with those letters give or take) and the Georgia tech financial aid application,
Snowfish#4289,07-May-18 01:52 PM,@saxon_dr#3806 they pretty much tell you to look at them on google,
Snowfish#4289,07-May-18 01:52 PM,they’re fucking worthless,
saxon_dr#3806,07-May-18 01:54 PM,yikes,
saxon_dr#3806,07-May-18 01:54 PM,so what are some good resources for figuring this stuff out?,
saxon_dr#3806,07-May-18 01:55 PM,or since we don't have to commit to it right away do we just spend the first year exploring options and decide based on that?,
FinitePeach#1792,07-May-18 02:09 PM,Talking to upperclassmen and asking them about threads is probably the best way,
Snowfish#4289,07-May-18 02:25 PM,i don’t think you need to even declare threads until your second year,
Snowfish#4289,07-May-18 02:26 PM,"and even then, you don’t really need them until you start signing up for classes that are thread locked... which are 2nd semester junior year classes",
saxon_dr#3806,07-May-18 02:29 PM,oh nice,
saxon_dr#3806,07-May-18 02:29 PM,so don't need to worry about it for now i guess,
Snowfish#4289,07-May-18 02:31 PM,"ye if i were you, i’d try to take CS 1000 or whatever as soon as possible",
Snowfish#4289,07-May-18 02:31 PM,since i think they go over threads,

Rye#0666,10-May-18 01:34 PM,Yeah I just wanna relax,
Snowfish#4289,10-May-18 01:39 PM,that’s completely fair and probably the healthy decision,

mic#7575,10-May-18 04:31 PM,wait so you're all out of school already but you still have APs?,
mic#7575,10-May-18 04:31 PM,can OOS people take community college classes for transferable credit too?,
Snowfish#4289,10-May-18 04:49 PM,probably?,
Snowfish#4289,10-May-18 04:49 PM,just look at the transfer equivalency list,
KyotoKoto#5113,10-May-18 06:33 PM,@mic#7575  i took all my classes at GSU instead of going to high school. GSU finished classes 2 weeks ago so that's why i don't have to worry about APs,

waffle.dynasty#2740,11-May-18 04:49 PM,"Since FASET 1 is June 26-27, doesn't that mean Tech won't have our most recent AP scores",
waffle.dynasty#2740,11-May-18 04:49 PM,That kinda sucks given that we register at FASET,
Quantum#1480,11-May-18 04:50 PM,I know if you sent them straight there they get it a couple days in advance,
Quantum#1480,11-May-18 04:51 PM,May still be too early though,

Snowfish#4289,11-May-18 05:28 PM,really? are they not out?,
Snowfish#4289,11-May-18 05:28 PM,i definitely registered for ENGL 1102 after taking AP lot as a senior,
Lennox#3038,11-May-18 05:29 PM,Ap scores come out july 5th this year,
arechawla#3188,11-May-18 05:29 PM,Yea that's kirov @Quantum#1480,
arechawla#3188,11-May-18 05:30 PM,You guys know each other?,
8726andrew#5709,11-May-18 05:31 PM,Lol when they come out vs when colleges get them is not the same day,
8726andrew#5709,11-May-18 05:32 PM,I could check my scores earlier than the date bc I sent them to tech and they had it available,
Snowfish#4289,11-May-18 05:33 PM,^ this is true,
Lennox#3038,11-May-18 05:35 PM,"In that case, hopefully they'll have a way to let everyone know their scores at faset 1",
Snowfish#4289,11-May-18 05:36 PM,probably,
Rye#0666,11-May-18 05:36 PM,Yeah they come out the week of July 4 so they'd probably have them,
Snowfish#4289,11-May-18 05:36 PM,can’t believe that’s so late this year,
Rye#0666,11-May-18 05:36 PM,Don't colleges get them like a week in advance?,
Snowfish#4289,11-May-18 05:36 PM,i could’ve sworn we got them earlier,
Rye#0666,11-May-18 05:36 PM,AP exams?,
Snowfish#4289,11-May-18 05:36 PM,yea,
Snowfish#4289,11-May-18 05:36 PM,the scores,
Rye#0666,11-May-18 05:37 PM,They always come out like the first full week of July iirc,
Snowfish#4289,11-May-18 05:37 PM,maybe i have the memory of a goldfish,
8726andrew#5709,11-May-18 05:37 PM,The staggering of release times for scores is such garbage lol,
8726andrew#5709,11-May-18 05:37 PM,Cb is too cheap to buy servers that can handle the load,
Rye#0666,11-May-18 05:42 PM,Everyone just uses a VPN anyways to get around it lol,
Rye#0666,11-May-18 05:42 PM,Or 3rd party sites,
Rye#0666,11-May-18 05:42 PM,That's how I found out,
8726andrew#5709,11-May-18 05:43 PM,It’s faster to just send it to a college anyways lol,
8726andrew#5709,11-May-18 05:43 PM,So it works out for us,
Rye#0666,11-May-18 05:45 PM,:SquidDab:,
Rye#0666,11-May-18 05:45 PM,At least I remembered to send my scores this year,
Rye#0666,11-May-18 05:45 PM,Last year I didn't think about sending them to GT for the distance math class so I was panicking trying to get them to send in time,
mic#7575,11-May-18 06:01 PM,does going to FASET let you register for classes early?,
mic#7575,11-May-18 06:02 PM,FASET didn’t seem worth it based on the info booklet I got in the mail but maybe I’m missing something,
Lennox#3038,11-May-18 06:09 PM,"Yeah, faset lets you register for classes early",
Lennox#3038,11-May-18 06:09 PM,I'm guessing that's the main reason why people go,
Lennox#3038,11-May-18 06:24 PM,in faaaact,
Lennox#3038,11-May-18 06:24 PM,gatech online propaganda says that 98% of students attend it,
Lennox#3038,11-May-18 06:28 PM,which means that someone who doesnt go might be left with nothing but scraps later on,
Lennox#3038,11-May-18 06:29 PM,(although there still is phase II registration and all that jazz),
saxon_dr#3806,11-May-18 06:30 PM,hmm snowfish since you said you took the 2016 CS exam then i think you just misremembered,
saxon_dr#3806,11-May-18 06:31 PM,cuz i took BC that year and definitely didn't get it till july 5,
saxon_dr#3806,11-May-18 06:31 PM,unless you saw it from college in which case that's different,

Snowfish#4289,11-May-18 07:02 PM,also i’m pretty sure FASET is required,
Snowfish#4289,11-May-18 07:02 PM,not sure tho,
saxon_dr#3806,11-May-18 07:03 PM,it says on the pamphlet that it's optional,
Snowfish#4289,11-May-18 07:07 PM,nvm,

8726andrew#5709,11-May-18 07:58 PM,seems counter intuitive,
mic#7575,11-May-18 08:13 PM,98%?? Jeez,
mic#7575,11-May-18 08:13 PM,Because it costs $225 or something,
mic#7575,11-May-18 08:14 PM,I guess not getting classes I don’t want might be worth the price,
thedragonlegacy#2854,11-May-18 08:15 PM,"🤔🤔🤔 hm, I would think so too. You also want to make sure you have good professors",
Snowfish#4289,11-May-18 08:16 PM,i BELIEVE it goes through your bursar account which means it can be covered by scholarships,
Snowfish#4289,11-May-18 08:16 PM,but then again i’m only useful 50% is the time so that’s about 50% a lie,
mic#7575,11-May-18 08:17 PM,ngl feels like I’m getting scammed but I guess I’ll register then,
mic#7575,11-May-18 08:18 PM,is it better to pick an earlier week then?,
Snowfish#4289,11-May-18 08:18 PM,you pay $200 to be brainwashed,
Snowfish#4289,11-May-18 08:18 PM,then register,
Snowfish#4289,11-May-18 08:18 PM,yes it’s better,
mic#7575,11-May-18 08:19 PM,wait I need to get a plane ticket too,
mic#7575,11-May-18 08:19 PM,can I get someone already in Atlanta to represent me?,
mic#7575,11-May-18 08:20 PM,register for classes and learn about GATech on my behalf,
Snowfish#4289,11-May-18 08:20 PM,all you really need is someone to sign in for you lol,
MEE6#4876,11-May-18 08:20 PM,"GG @Snowfish#4289, you just advanced to level 15!",
Snowfish#4289,11-May-18 08:21 PM,then your time ticket opens and you can do it anywhere,
Snowfish#4289,11-May-18 08:21 PM,i had a friend who had stable connection back home fill out my classes while i went on a walk,
Snowfish#4289,11-May-18 08:21 PM,they only check who is present when you sign in at like 8AM,
Snowfish#4289,11-May-18 08:21 PM,dunno if i could pass as a “michael chen”,
thedragonlegacy#2854,11-May-18 08:22 PM,"I can pass as a Michael Chen , 10/10",

8726andrew#5709,11-May-18 08:29 PM,🤔,
mic#7575,11-May-18 08:30 PM,here’s what Reddit says about earlier FASETs:,
mic#7575,11-May-18 08:30 PM,,https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/402517390669381633/444657582238334977/image.png
mic#7575,11-May-18 08:32 PM,so I guess if I pick one of the later ones I can just move in earlier and I won’t have to pay for extra airplane tickets,
bopas2#1774,11-May-18 09:12 PM,"the later ones require a certain distance to register for, i forget what it is tho",
8726andrew#5709,11-May-18 09:12 PM,no they just give the people who live far away preference,
Snowfish#4289,11-May-18 09:14 PM,so ive explained it once but i think it was in DMs to someone so i’ll type it again,
Snowfish#4289,11-May-18 09:14 PM,"the general idea of FASET is that they told sears exclusively for “first semester freshman” classes, that is, classes you are expected to take either first or second semester (like basic english classes, entry level math, etc)",
Snowfish#4289,11-May-18 09:15 PM,"but if you’re coming in with AP credits or you want to take a humanities or social studies class, those seats aren’t held for FASET since upperclassmen also need them",
Snowfish#4289,11-May-18 09:16 PM,"now there’s not a lot of seats still open for those classes and no additional seats are coming so, if you want more options available for your first semester (and trust me, with how shitty scheduling is, you will really struggle to make a not-hideous schedule that’s full time), it’s better to take an earlier FASET",
Snowfish#4289,11-May-18 09:16 PM,"not saying it’s impossible, but it’s generally better. 4/5 classes i took my first semester didn’t give seats in FASET",
Snowfish#4289,11-May-18 09:17 PM,tl;dr not all of the classes you might want give staggered seating for FASET,
angrymunch739#7866,11-May-18 09:17 PM,What should the hours be for freshman schedule? @Snowfish#4289,
Chafos#1781,11-May-18 09:17 PM,in the 2nd paragraph when you said told sears did you mean hold seats,
angrymunch739#7866,11-May-18 09:17 PM,Recommend hours,
Snowfish#4289,11-May-18 09:17 PM,"full time is 12+ hours, but a “general” schedule is 15",
Snowfish#4289,11-May-18 09:18 PM,"that is, if you want to graduate this millennium, you’ll want to shoot for 15 hours every semester.",
Snowfish#4289,11-May-18 09:18 PM,that’s 5 classes on average,
Snowfish#4289,11-May-18 09:18 PM,5 3-hour classes,
angrymunch739#7866,11-May-18 09:18 PM,Is 15 manageable?,
Snowfish#4289,11-May-18 09:18 PM,yeah @Chafos#1781 i’m on mobile so it’s just autocorrect,
8726andrew#5709,11-May-18 09:18 PM,depends on the class,
Chafos#1781,11-May-18 09:18 PM,gotcha,
Snowfish#4289,11-May-18 09:18 PM,yea i’ve taken 15+ every semester and it’s not hard at all,
Snowfish#4289,11-May-18 09:18 PM,"well, i take that back",
Snowfish#4289,11-May-18 09:18 PM,it’s not overwhelmingly impossible,
Snowfish#4289,11-May-18 09:19 PM,there will always be times when you get kinda fucked by taking 15 (like two exams back to back on the same day) but it’s not often and it’s just bad luck,
angrymunch739#7866,11-May-18 09:19 PM,Ok where would the hours requirement be for my major cant find it,
Snowfish#4289,11-May-18 09:20 PM,"there’s no requirement, it’s like a general rule that 12+ is full time",
Snowfish#4289,11-May-18 09:20 PM,like for scholarships and loans and stuff,
angrymunch739#7866,11-May-18 09:20 PM,Would 15 hrs be enough for 4 year degree?,
angrymunch739#7866,11-May-18 09:20 PM,Ideally,
8726andrew#5709,11-May-18 09:21 PM,different degrees have different hour requirements,
8726andrew#5709,11-May-18 09:21 PM,i think when i last looked at me it was like 120 or 140 or something i forget,
Snowfish#4289,11-May-18 09:21 PM,yes but i think the highest is 135,
angrymunch739#7866,11-May-18 09:21 PM,I think it is 140,
Snowfish#4289,11-May-18 09:21 PM,it’s generally 126-135,
angrymunch739#7866,11-May-18 09:21 PM,Oh,
Snowfish#4289,11-May-18 09:21 PM,CS is 126,
angrymunch739#7866,11-May-18 09:21 PM,Cmpe?,
Snowfish#4289,11-May-18 09:21 PM,no idea sorry,
Snowfish#4289,11-May-18 09:21 PM,engineering are generally like 132?,
Snowfish#4289,11-May-18 09:21 PM,i think,
angrymunch739#7866,11-May-18 09:22 PM,Is cmpe a dying work field?,
Snowfish#4289,11-May-18 09:22 PM,it’s always 8 full time semesters + a partial semester,
angrymunch739#7866,11-May-18 09:22 PM,Thats what some students are saying,
angrymunch739#7866,11-May-18 09:23 PM,Do you think cmpe is becoming less valuable?,
angrymunch739#7866,11-May-18 09:23 PM,As in degree,
angrymunch739#7866,11-May-18 09:23 PM,@Snowfish#4289,
Snowfish#4289,11-May-18 09:23 PM,i don’t really know,
Snowfish#4289,11-May-18 09:24 PM,i think every degree (within reason) is viable as long as you’re willing to be kind of flexible in terms of what you do,
angrymunch739#7866,11-May-18 09:24 PM,Also do you get help during class registration at faset or do you have to be like ready to sign up before hand,
Snowfish#4289,11-May-18 09:24 PM,yes the entire second day is more or less designated to sitting down with your advisor,
Snowfish#4289,11-May-18 09:25 PM,they help you make a desired schedule,
angrymunch739#7866,11-May-18 09:25 PM,"Oh nice, thats a relief",
Snowfish#4289,11-May-18 09:25 PM,i was originally chemE so i can’t speak for EVERY major but,
Snowfish#4289,11-May-18 09:25 PM,they laid out an entire 4 year schedule for me there,
angrymunch739#7866,11-May-18 09:25 PM,Oh nice they help desgin a 4 year plan at faset or is that later on,
Snowfish#4289,11-May-18 09:26 PM,at FASST,
Snowfish#4289,11-May-18 09:26 PM,assume that’s spelled correctly,
angrymunch739#7866,11-May-18 09:27 PM,"How many classes should I expect for freshman year, I want to look up what classes to choose",
Snowfish#4289,11-May-18 09:27 PM,5,
Snowfish#4289,11-May-18 09:27 PM,if you’re full time,
Snowfish#4289,11-May-18 09:27 PM,which i assume you are,
Snowfish#4289,11-May-18 09:27 PM,5 per semester** that is,
angrymunch739#7866,11-May-18 09:27 PM,"Yeah, thanks man you're so helpful",
Snowfish#4289,11-May-18 09:28 PM,i’d really wait until you guys have access to degreeworks to look at classes you need,
angrymunch739#7866,11-May-18 09:28 PM,Much appreciated,
Snowfish#4289,11-May-18 09:28 PM,the catalog resources online are dogshit,
Snowfish#4289,11-May-18 09:28 PM,it’s like 15 different pages to tell you what you have to take,
angrymunch739#7866,11-May-18 09:28 PM,Yeah Ill just look around to get a few ideas dont wanna go to faset without knowing anything regarding classes,
Snowfish#4289,11-May-18 09:29 PM,i think you’ll have degreeworks way before FASET,
Snowfish#4289,11-May-18 09:29 PM,can you guys get into buzzport yet,
Snowfish#4289,11-May-18 09:29 PM,https://buzzport.gatech.edu/cp/home/check/pre,

angrymunch739#7866,11-May-18 09:31 PM,Assuming we're not students yet :PepeHands:,
Snowfish#4289,11-May-18 09:31 PM,hmm maybe try signing into it directly?,
Snowfish#4289,11-May-18 09:32 PM,https://degreeaudit.gatech.edu/dashboard,
angrymunch739#7866,11-May-18 09:33 PM,Nope...,
Snowfish#4289,11-May-18 09:33 PM,unfortunate,

Chafos#1781,11-May-18 09:33 PM,after username= was some numbers not tryna get hacked tho,
angrymunch739#7866,11-May-18 09:34 PM,Is it a good idea to look at degree requirements and make a list of the entry classes,
Snowfish#4289,11-May-18 09:34 PM,"well if i remember correctly, at some point your entry splash page of literally nothing but CONGRATS ENTER UR DEPOSIT HERE switches to at least something useful.",
Snowfish#4289,11-May-18 09:35 PM,whenever that happens is probably when you get to actually do things,
Snowfish#4289,11-May-18 09:35 PM,also yeah you can do that @angrymunch739#7866,
angrymunch739#7866,11-May-18 09:36 PM,Sweet,
efank#9753,11-May-18 09:36 PM,Fall term,
efank#9753,11-May-18 09:36 PM,starts on the 20th right,
efank#9753,11-May-18 09:36 PM,but there's FASET a week before?,
angrymunch739#7866,11-May-18 09:37 PM,Yeah should start around August 20th,
angrymunch739#7866,11-May-18 09:39 PM,My major is 132 hrs,
Snowfish#4289,11-May-18 09:39 PM,fun,
angrymunch739#7866,11-May-18 09:44 PM,How many elective courses should freshmans take first year?,
angrymunch739#7866,11-May-18 09:45 PM,Recommendations?,
Snowfish#4289,11-May-18 09:45 PM,honestly it 120% depends on scheduling,
Snowfish#4289,11-May-18 09:45 PM,i can’t really tell you since i don’t know every single class’s scheduling for each semester,
Snowfish#4289,11-May-18 09:46 PM,"if it’s better to take all electives, take all electives",
Snowfish#4289,11-May-18 09:46 PM,"i’d say avoid it if you have to but if you can’t, no harm done",
efank#9753,11-May-18 09:46 PM,oh wait,
efank#9753,11-May-18 09:46 PM,how does the schedule actually work then,
efank#9753,11-May-18 09:46 PM,is it like 4 classes a semester?,
efank#9753,11-May-18 09:46 PM,this isnt' hs anymore  Iguess,
Snowfish#4289,11-May-18 09:46 PM,5,
8726andrew#5709,11-May-18 09:46 PM,however many you take,
8726andrew#5709,11-May-18 09:46 PM,its your life now,
Snowfish#4289,11-May-18 09:46 PM,yeah ^^,
Snowfish#4289,11-May-18 09:46 PM,that,
efank#9753,11-May-18 09:47 PM,yeah ok I guess it's not like HS anymore w/ block schedules,
Snowfish#4289,11-May-18 09:47 PM,you can have pretty much anything you want from 8AM to 6PM,
efank#9753,11-May-18 09:48 PM,it's just a matter of if it fits in your schedule (scheduling conflicts) and being practicability right?,
efank#9753,11-May-18 09:48 PM,yeah that makes more sense now,
Snowfish#4289,11-May-18 09:48 PM,yes,
Snowfish#4289,11-May-18 09:48 PM,like if you have a 8AM class you really don’t want a 6PM class,
Snowfish#4289,11-May-18 09:48 PM,you will lose your mind,
efank#9753,11-May-18 09:49 PM,speaking from personal experience huh,
Snowfish#4289,11-May-18 09:49 PM,no i’ve always tried to schedule them close,
angrymunch739#7866,11-May-18 09:49 PM,Do you find 8am classes as good?,
efank#9753,11-May-18 09:49 PM,^,
Snowfish#4289,11-May-18 09:49 PM,but i did have a 1PM lecture and then a 6PM lab,
Snowfish#4289,11-May-18 09:49 PM,which was miserable,
Snowfish#4289,11-May-18 09:49 PM,hahaha you’re crazy if you think i’ve ever taken a class before noon,
angrymunch739#7866,11-May-18 09:49 PM,"What are the usual time for classes like 6 am, 8 am ....??",
Snowfish#4289,11-May-18 09:50 PM,i’d say the highest density is in like the noon-3PM range,
angrymunch739#7866,11-May-18 09:50 PM,How many labs did u take freshman year? How was it,
efank#9753,11-May-18 09:50 PM,why do noon classes even exist 🤔,
efank#9753,11-May-18 09:51 PM,"also, wait is the calendar for 2019 up?",
efank#9753,11-May-18 09:51 PM,aka when does spring term tart,
brumeux#4293,11-May-18 09:51 PM,why are almost all the linear algebra courses at 8am and is it feasible to actually succeed in an 8am class,
efank#9753,11-May-18 09:52 PM,^ lol,
efank#9753,11-May-18 09:52 PM,"wait leg, how do you know when the courses start",

Snowfish#4289,11-May-18 10:20 PM,what major are you,

Snowfish#4289,11-May-18 10:20 PM,https://www.math.gatech.edu/sites/default/files/documents/new_math_major_requirements.pdf,
Snowfish#4289,11-May-18 10:20 PM,oh god please,
Snowfish#4289,11-May-18 10:20 PM,whatever you do,
Snowfish#4289,11-May-18 10:20 PM,do NOT take 1371,
efank#9753,11-May-18 10:20 PM,why,
Snowfish#4289,11-May-18 10:21 PM,unless you’re an engineer and have t take it anyways,
efank#9753,11-May-18 10:21 PM,i think i can credit my way out of 1301,
MEE6#4876,11-May-18 10:21 PM,"GG @efank#9753, you just advanced to level 7!",
Snowfish#4289,11-May-18 10:21 PM,because those professors are :monkaS:,
brumeux#4293,11-May-18 10:21 PM,so 1315?,
Snowfish#4289,11-May-18 10:21 PM,yes,
Snowfish#4289,11-May-18 10:21 PM,1301 is python also so if you know python you can also take that,
Snowfish#4289,11-May-18 10:22 PM,but strong pref 1315,
Quantum#1480,11-May-18 10:22 PM,I took 1301 online and it was pretty easy honestly,
efank#9753,11-May-18 10:22 PM,how'd you take it online,
Quantum#1480,11-May-18 10:23 PM,People taking DL Math through Tech had the option to take CS as well,
efank#9753,11-May-18 10:23 PM,wait are there courses that I can take online at gt over the summer,
Quantum#1480,11-May-18 10:23 PM,I think they wanted to test it first before rolling it out to everyone,
Snowfish#4289,11-May-18 10:23 PM,i don’t think so as a freshman,
Snowfish#4289,11-May-18 10:23 PM,pretty sure it’s locked to upperclassmen,
efank#9753,11-May-18 10:23 PM,oh but it is a thing right,

Snowfish#4289,11-May-18 10:27 PM,“here’s my suggestion” and rarely overrides,

Snowfish#4289,11-May-18 10:28 PM,for freshman they’re more than helpful,
angrymunch739#7866,11-May-18 10:29 PM,Lol lol,
Snowfish#4289,11-May-18 10:29 PM,i’ve been scorned by my advisor so i no longer put in a good word for them at all,

Snowfish#4289,11-May-18 10:29 PM,"he basically told me, in professional terms of course, to fuck off",
Snowfish#4289,11-May-18 10:29 PM,all i did was ask for a permit into a 1 credit hour class that has 25/50 seats still available,

Samsung#6949,13-May-18 07:55 PM,^^ I had no idea what I was doing on one of the mechanics frqs last year and still pulled in that 5,
udishab#2211,13-May-18 07:55 PM,that's honestly rly reassuring thank you,
Lennox#3038,13-May-18 07:56 PM,when in doubt write random formulas down,
Samsung#6949,13-May-18 07:57 PM,You can get like 80% of the physics points if you write out all the relevant eqs and put an answer with the correct units,
KyotoKoto#5113,13-May-18 09:33 PM,"^this x100 , , lol i did E&M last year and that's where i suspect where my points came from because i had 0 clue what to do",
Snowfish#4289,13-May-18 09:38 PM,i did that and i still got a 4 :FeelsBadMan:,
Snowfish#4289,13-May-18 09:38 PM,i had the international version tho so they probably graded harder,
bopas2#1774,13-May-18 10:14 PM,I looked at the 2017 frq,

Rye#0666,13-May-18 10:59 PM,I think I'll be fine on Mechanics,
Rye#0666,13-May-18 10:59 PM,E&M is going to be a mess,
Samsung#6949,13-May-18 11:00 PM,I mean it seems that way because the concepts are harder,
Samsung#6949,13-May-18 11:00 PM,But I thought the E&M questions were honestly easier than mech,

saxon_dr#3806,14-May-18 09:43 AM,probably best thing to do now is to just email them,
saxon_dr#3806,14-May-18 09:43 AM,also did you see what it is for fall student,
joazlazer#2041,14-May-18 09:55 AM,For me fall deadline is June 11,
joazlazer#2041,14-May-18 09:55 AM,idk,
joazlazer#2041,14-May-18 09:55 AM,it says any outstanding vaccines will be administered at FASET,
joazlazer#2041,14-May-18 09:56 AM,so it sounds like the 'deadline' is more of just a 'requested date' to reduce the processing workload,
joazlazer#2041,14-May-18 09:59 AM,Either way I'm working on getting it all submitted as soon as possible,
Rye#0666,14-May-18 10:17 AM,@thedragonlegacy#2854 Why are you not taking Mechanics?,
Rye#0666,14-May-18 10:17 AM,Did you already take the exam?,
thedragonlegacy#2854,14-May-18 10:26 AM,no... they only offered 1 physics c class,
thedragonlegacy#2854,14-May-18 10:26 AM,":,<",
saxon_dr#3806,14-May-18 10:28 AM,oh you don't have a year long course,
saxon_dr#3806,14-May-18 10:28 AM,and the one they offer is e&m?,
saxon_dr#3806,14-May-18 10:28 AM,that's kinda odd,
thedragonlegacy#2854,14-May-18 10:30 AM,yeah,
Cleanfel#8596,14-May-18 10:33 AM,My school has mechanics but not e&m,
Rye#0666,14-May-18 10:58 AM,I hated E&M so I'm probably not going to do well on it but eh,
Rye#0666,14-May-18 10:58 AM,I'll be fine on Mechanics,
Snowfish#4289,14-May-18 11:04 AM,@joazlazer#2041 are you doing late summer classes?,
thelame#9847,14-May-18 11:45 AM,anyone know if it’s ok to put georgia tech’s generic address under ‘Address where you will stay in the US’ for F1 visa application?,
angrymunch739#7866,14-May-18 02:20 PM,How was physics exam?,
angrymunch739#7866,14-May-18 02:20 PM,Heard the frq was pretty easy,
Cleanfel#8596,14-May-18 02:26 PM,"2 weren't too bad, last one was a mess",
Gadget246#0848,14-May-18 02:57 PM,music theory exam was an L of monstrous proportions,
Caw#1913,14-May-18 03:04 PM,I've heard that one is terrible,
Caw#1913,14-May-18 03:04 PM,Even for people who have studied music extensively,
thedragonlegacy#2854,14-May-18 03:54 PM,I didn’t get to finish the last FRQ for emag,
thedragonlegacy#2854,14-May-18 03:54 PM,: < what even is a plastic sphere,
thedragonlegacy#2854,14-May-18 03:55 PM,: < why do u gotta c/(1/d),
saxon_dr#3806,14-May-18 04:04 PM,plastic sphere so that the charge is field isnt' just on the surface?,
saxon_dr#3806,14-May-18 04:04 PM,i think,
saxon_dr#3806,14-May-18 04:04 PM,don't really remember my e&m tho ngl,

Chafos#1781,14-May-18 05:31 PM,"@angrymunch739#7866 I hope they were talking about the mechanics FRQ, I thought the E&M FRQ was atrocious",
Chafos#1781,14-May-18 05:31 PM,I got the gauss’ law stuff and then it ALL went to shit,
Chafos#1781,14-May-18 05:32 PM,except for the second part of #2 and a handful of points on #3,
waffle.dynasty#2740,14-May-18 05:33 PM,My E&M form had no Gauss's Law lol,
Chafos#1781,14-May-18 05:34 PM,oh wow lol,
Chafos#1781,14-May-18 05:34 PM,it was my #1,
bopas2#1774,14-May-18 05:41 PM,"I agree, that e&m frq hurt me bad",
angrymunch739#7866,14-May-18 06:30 PM,@Chafos#1781 yeah physics mechanics,
Chafos#1781,14-May-18 06:42 PM,ok good just making sure,
Chafos#1781,14-May-18 06:54 PM,"it seems like the two most common forms were Form E and Form O, I had Form O",
Rye#0666,14-May-18 06:55 PM,Form :OMEGALUL:,
Snowfish#4289,14-May-18 07:18 PM,get form M,
Snowfish#4289,14-May-18 07:18 PM,pretty sure that's international,
Snowfish#4289,14-May-18 07:18 PM,iirc,
Cole#0059,14-May-18 08:04 PM,i thought the mechanics was like foreign and just the hardest thing in the world and then the e&M was manageable,
8726andrew#5709,14-May-18 08:13 PM,For the second one it was like c/e0a and 1/d for the graph I though,
8726andrew#5709,14-May-18 08:13 PM,It was dumb af,
8726andrew#5709,14-May-18 08:13 PM,The first question was free bc all I studied was gauss’ law lmao,
8726andrew#5709,14-May-18 08:14 PM,Don’t even talk about the third one,
8726andrew#5709,14-May-18 08:14 PM,And I’ve lost all memory of mechanics,
bopas2#1774,14-May-18 08:16 PM,"yeah i messed up the graph for the second frq big time, hopefully partial credit and ecf saves the day",
Chafos#1781,14-May-18 08:23 PM,yup same,
Chafos#1781,14-May-18 08:23 PM,I left the whole damn graph part blank lmao,
Chafos#1781,14-May-18 08:24 PM,when literally all it was was do 1/d or 1/C -_-,
angrymunch739#7866,14-May-18 08:31 PM,Is faset optional,
saxon_dr#3806,14-May-18 08:33 PM,apparently so,
saxon_dr#3806,14-May-18 08:33 PM,but i think most people do it,
Le Noir DragooN#8434,14-May-18 08:50 PM,i'm chilling,

Snowfish#4289,14-May-18 08:50 PM,im taking physics this summer,
Snowfish#4289,14-May-18 08:50 PM,yay,
Snowfish#4289,14-May-18 08:50 PM,today i learned about lines,

Snowfish#4289,14-May-18 08:52 PM,?,
Le Noir DragooN#8434,14-May-18 08:52 PM,what about lines,
saxon_dr#3806,14-May-18 08:52 PM,lines :POGGERS:,
Snowfish#4289,14-May-18 08:53 PM,"im kidding, we learned about vectors",
saxon_dr#3806,14-May-18 08:53 PM,wow,
Le Noir DragooN#8434,14-May-18 08:53 PM,oh,
Snowfish#4289,14-May-18 08:54 PM,i got a 4 on the mechanics exam so time to DO IT ALL AGAIN WOO,
saxon_dr#3806,14-May-18 08:54 PM,other than the requirement is there any time that i actually need to know phys,
saxon_dr#3806,14-May-18 08:54 PM,cuz i don't remember much <a:OMEGALULCEPTION:394000303235530752>,
Le Noir DragooN#8434,14-May-18 08:54 PM,don't you write a test or something to transfer a 4 for credit?,
Snowfish#4289,14-May-18 08:54 PM,its a fucking hard test,
Snowfish#4289,14-May-18 08:54 PM,like i studied a little from my AP review book and i got dumpstered by it,
Le Noir DragooN#8434,14-May-18 08:55 PM,😦,
Snowfish#4289,14-May-18 08:55 PM,i mean granted i took it as a junior so,
Le Noir DragooN#8434,14-May-18 08:55 PM,me toooo,
Snowfish#4289,14-May-18 08:55 PM,also wdym julian,
saxon_dr#3806,14-May-18 08:55 PM,same,
saxon_dr#3806,14-May-18 08:55 PM,like if i take the AP credit,
Snowfish#4289,14-May-18 08:56 PM,also also i preferred your old profpic,
saxon_dr#3806,14-May-18 08:56 PM,will i ever run into phys again,
Snowfish#4289,14-May-18 08:56 PM,no,
saxon_dr#3806,14-May-18 08:56 PM,oh yeah same i was just kinda feeling this one cuz i just saw this movie in the weekends,
saxon_dr#3806,14-May-18 08:56 PM,probably gonna switch it back at some point,
Snowfish#4289,14-May-18 08:57 PM,i need to change mine too,
Snowfish#4289,14-May-18 08:57 PM,this one was just a temporary one,
Snowfish#4289,14-May-18 08:57 PM,:PepeHands:,
Le Noir DragooN#8434,14-May-18 08:57 PM,@Snowfish#4289 did you take e&m too?,
Snowfish#4289,14-May-18 08:57 PM,yea,
Snowfish#4289,14-May-18 08:57 PM,i got a 4 :OMEGALUL:,
Le Noir DragooN#8434,14-May-18 08:57 PM,dual fours not bad,
saxon_dr#3806,14-May-18 08:57 PM,hey i know someone that got a 5 last year,
saxon_dr#3806,14-May-18 08:57 PM,two combined,
saxon_dr#3806,14-May-18 08:57 PM,:lilyXD:,
Le Noir DragooN#8434,14-May-18 08:57 PM,that's me ^_^,
Snowfish#4289,14-May-18 08:57 PM,my fucking e&m frq actually put me on suicide watch,
Snowfish#4289,14-May-18 08:58 PM,like ngl i still have nightmares about it,
saxon_dr#3806,14-May-18 08:58 PM,did u get the normal form,
Snowfish#4289,14-May-18 08:58 PM,no i got international for both mech and e&m,
saxon_dr#3806,14-May-18 08:58 PM,or did you get the alt version,
saxon_dr#3806,14-May-18 08:58 PM,cuz my friend got the e&m alt version,
saxon_dr#3806,14-May-18 08:58 PM,she's super smart so she figured it out but,
saxon_dr#3806,14-May-18 08:58 PM,she told me there was time constant stuff,
saxon_dr#3806,14-May-18 08:58 PM,and RL circuits,
saxon_dr#3806,14-May-18 08:58 PM,sounds rough,
saxon_dr#3806,14-May-18 08:58 PM,wait i mean LC circuits,
Le Noir DragooN#8434,14-May-18 08:58 PM,my school doesn't have a physics c class,
Le Noir DragooN#8434,14-May-18 08:59 PM,cuz i go to an average public high school,
Snowfish#4289,14-May-18 08:59 PM,"i think there's like the normal version, the alt version, and the international version",
Snowfish#4289,14-May-18 08:59 PM,my school got like randomly selected to do the M form,
saxon_dr#3806,14-May-18 08:59 PM,yeah idk if she got the international or alt,
Snowfish#4289,14-May-18 08:59 PM,we got fucked by it,
saxon_dr#3806,14-May-18 08:59 PM,oh rip,
Snowfish#4289,14-May-18 08:59 PM,went from 90% 5's to 60% above a 3,

saxon_dr#3806,14-May-18 09:00 PM,for like 3 years,
Snowfish#4289,14-May-18 09:00 PM,wot,

efank#9753,14-May-18 09:02 PM,that im' going to a technical institute,
Snowfish#4289,14-May-18 09:02 PM,the e&m one was like 80% induction,

Le Noir DragooN#8434,14-May-18 09:03 PM,"the exam writers get excited whilst writing the question, so they forget their target students",
efank#9753,14-May-18 09:03 PM,i got form I,
Snowfish#4289,14-May-18 09:03 PM,aint that the truth,
efank#9753,14-May-18 09:03 PM,capital i,
saxon_dr#3806,14-May-18 09:03 PM,apparently still more than 30% gets 5's every year,
saxon_dr#3806,14-May-18 09:03 PM,who are these people,
efank#9753,14-May-18 09:03 PM,we get to take a placement thoguh,
efank#9753,14-May-18 09:03 PM,if we get a 4,
saxon_dr#3806,14-May-18 09:03 PM,ok first thigns they probably didn't get form M,
saxon_dr#3806,14-May-18 09:04 PM,according to snowfish,
saxon_dr#3806,14-May-18 09:04 PM,that's a lot harder than the AP,
Snowfish#4289,14-May-18 09:04 PM,:FeelsBadMan:,
Le Noir DragooN#8434,14-May-18 09:04 PM,gatech placement test i wouldn't expect anything less than impossible,
efank#9753,14-May-18 09:04 PM,thing is maybe the exam made me realize i don't know my shit,
efank#9753,14-May-18 09:04 PM,so i should just retake it,
efank#9753,14-May-18 09:04 PM,yeah exactly aadirag lmao,
Snowfish#4289,14-May-18 09:04 PM,the placement tests are finals from the spring semester,
saxon_dr#3806,14-May-18 09:04 PM,yeah honestly i think retaking probably isn't that bad,
saxon_dr#3806,14-May-18 09:04 PM,if i actually cared about knowing my phys i probably woulda done it too,
Snowfish#4289,14-May-18 09:05 PM,do not retake it,
saxon_dr#3806,14-May-18 09:05 PM,but i really dont right now,
efank#9753,14-May-18 09:05 PM,oh,
Snowfish#4289,14-May-18 09:05 PM,its intentionally a really hard class,
saxon_dr#3806,14-May-18 09:05 PM,so fk that,
efank#9753,14-May-18 09:05 PM,do not retke it?,
efank#9753,14-May-18 09:05 PM,why is it intentionally hard,
saxon_dr#3806,14-May-18 09:05 PM,to weed out kids,
saxon_dr#3806,14-May-18 09:05 PM,it's a public school after all,
efank#9753,14-May-18 09:05 PM,rly,
efank#9753,14-May-18 09:05 PM,that's kinda cynical,

efank#9753,14-May-18 09:06 PM,i should just go for the placement,
efank#9753,14-May-18 09:06 PM,if i get a 4 right,
Snowfish#4289,14-May-18 09:06 PM,^equivalent of e&m,
efank#9753,14-May-18 09:06 PM,is it hard?,
Snowfish#4289,14-May-18 09:06 PM,its free,
Snowfish#4289,14-May-18 09:06 PM,not like it hurts to try,
efank#9753,14-May-18 09:06 PM,to do well on the placement,
efank#9753,14-May-18 09:06 PM,ohh rly,
efank#9753,14-May-18 09:06 PM,it's free? aight,
Snowfish#4289,14-May-18 09:06 PM,yeah its fucking hard lol,
efank#9753,14-May-18 09:06 PM,time for more physics tudying over the break,
saxon_dr#3806,14-May-18 09:06 PM,yeah just take it,
Snowfish#4289,14-May-18 09:06 PM,probably the hardest test ive ever taken,
efank#9753,14-May-18 09:06 PM,but ok guys,
Snowfish#4289,14-May-18 09:06 PM,ngl,
efank#9753,14-May-18 09:06 PM,wait is that cynical to think,

Snowfish#4289,14-May-18 09:06 PM,there was some shit where like,
efank#9753,14-May-18 09:06 PM,it's intentionally hard,
efank#9753,14-May-18 09:06 PM,to weed ppl out,
saxon_dr#3806,14-May-18 09:06 PM,no that's a thing they actually do in public school,
efank#9753,14-May-18 09:07 PM,i don't know enough about colleges in general,
Snowfish#4289,14-May-18 09:07 PM,you had a moving crane and there was some force inside the pulley on the crane or some shit,
saxon_dr#3806,14-May-18 09:07 PM,"in private colleges there is this mentality of ""if we admit you we think you can do the work and survive""",
saxon_dr#3806,14-May-18 09:07 PM,in public schools that's not a thing afaik,
Snowfish#4289,14-May-18 09:07 PM,and then there was a pulley attached to the load of the crane,
Snowfish#4289,14-May-18 09:07 PM,and idk man it was whack,
Snowfish#4289,14-May-18 09:07 PM,like 15 forces all over the place,
efank#9753,14-May-18 09:07 PM,@saxon_dr#3806  to some extent I guess,
efank#9753,14-May-18 09:07 PM,maybe for the local admits,
efank#9753,14-May-18 09:07 PM,it's somewhat out of obligation,
efank#9753,14-May-18 09:07 PM,but maybe w/ private colleges that mentality would get to the point of,
efank#9753,14-May-18 09:07 PM,too much hand holding?,
saxon_dr#3806,14-May-18 09:08 PM,no i think it's just that public schools cuz they don't have all the fundings to have a really selective admissions program,
saxon_dr#3806,14-May-18 09:08 PM,they admit some kids that are like on the line for them,
Snowfish#4289,14-May-18 09:08 PM,the most prestigous schools know you're going to manage anyways so they might as well keep you from offing yourself from the stress,
saxon_dr#3806,14-May-18 09:08 PM,whereas private school ahs the resources to really look carefully through everything and make sure that you ahve what it takes,
bopas2#1774,14-May-18 09:09 PM,hm,
efank#9753,14-May-18 09:09 PM,hmmm,
Snowfish#4289,14-May-18 09:09 PM,high suicide rates :FeelsGoodMan:,
saxon_dr#3806,14-May-18 09:09 PM,i mean like we are a really good school but our admissions rate is like 25% or something,
bopas2#1774,14-May-18 09:09 PM,"To some extent, the average SAT or ACT kinda helps determine that idk",
saxon_dr#3806,14-May-18 09:09 PM,which is ridivulously high,
saxon_dr#3806,14-May-18 09:09 PM,idk i think SAT grades are inflated af,
efank#9753,14-May-18 09:09 PM,25% is not that high,
bopas2#1774,14-May-18 09:10 PM,"Also, remember, admission rates include non-stem majors and guaranteed admits or whatever",
saxon_dr#3806,14-May-18 09:10 PM,i just mean that some of our programs are top in the nation,
saxon_dr#3806,14-May-18 09:10 PM,so 25 is pretty high for that,
saxon_dr#3806,14-May-18 09:10 PM,imo,
efank#9753,14-May-18 09:11 PM,fair enough,
Snowfish#4289,14-May-18 09:11 PM,GT's administration are just in this super shitty mindset that they want to keep people there for as long as possible and make shit rough for them,
efank#9753,14-May-18 09:11 PM,really? but like mindset,
Snowfish#4289,14-May-18 09:11 PM,that's why we're pretty much the only top 100 uni that's suffering from grade deflation,
efank#9753,14-May-18 09:11 PM,is not something you can prove,
saxon_dr#3806,14-May-18 09:11 PM,lol,
efank#9753,14-May-18 09:11 PM,yeah ik you can feel it,
saxon_dr#3806,14-May-18 09:11 PM,well we can see for ourselves,
saxon_dr#3806,14-May-18 09:11 PM,once we're there,
efank#9753,14-May-18 09:11 PM,but yeah fine fair enough,
bopas2#1774,14-May-18 09:11 PM,its time for a revolution,
Snowfish#4289,14-May-18 09:11 PM,i mean im not a mind reader idk wtf causes it,
Snowfish#4289,14-May-18 09:11 PM,maybe its just like elitism,
efank#9753,14-May-18 09:11 PM,is there some,
efank#9753,14-May-18 09:11 PM,yeha,
efank#9753,14-May-18 09:12 PM,elitism to it,
efank#9753,14-May-18 09:12 PM,snowfish idk,
efank#9753,14-May-18 09:12 PM,"wait i mean, does it",
saxon_dr#3806,14-May-18 09:12 PM,i mean HYPS and ivy are definitely more elitist than we are,
efank#9753,14-May-18 09:12 PM,like if you can make it out of it,
efank#9753,14-May-18 09:12 PM,you are worth something,
efank#9753,14-May-18 09:12 PM,@saxon_dr#3806 I think it's a different kind of elitism though,
Snowfish#4289,14-May-18 09:12 PM,"true, i just don't agree with how intentionally difficult they seem to make it",
efank#9753,14-May-18 09:12 PM,hyps ivy is like i guess prestige elitism,
efank#9753,14-May-18 09:13 PM,gatech from what i'm making out of it,
efank#9753,14-May-18 09:13 PM,is like masochist elitism lol,
Snowfish#4289,14-May-18 09:13 PM,i mean there's a difference between prestige and elitism,
efank#9753,14-May-18 09:13 PM,yeah that too,
Snowfish#4289,14-May-18 09:13 PM,like they're 100% more prestigous but they might not be as elitist,
efank#9753,14-May-18 09:13 PM,hmmm wdym,
efank#9753,14-May-18 09:13 PM,by elitist then,
efank#9753,14-May-18 09:13 PM,like you have to be very good to survive,
Snowfish#4289,14-May-18 09:14 PM,uhh,
efank#9753,14-May-18 09:14 PM,?,
efank#9753,14-May-18 09:14 PM,yah,
Snowfish#4289,14-May-18 09:14 PM,no like the elitist mindset of the administration,
efank#9753,14-May-18 09:14 PM,"yeah, is'nt taht their mindset",
efank#9753,14-May-18 09:14 PM,like you have to be good enough to stay alive through it all,
Snowfish#4289,14-May-18 09:14 PM,yeah like idk,
efank#9753,14-May-18 09:15 PM,tbh though like i don't thnik that was a turn off,
efank#9753,14-May-18 09:15 PM,when committnig to gatech,
efank#9753,14-May-18 09:15 PM,maybe it will be once i'm actually there,
efank#9753,14-May-18 09:15 PM,like the grade deflation,
Snowfish#4289,14-May-18 09:15 PM,my only complaint is like,
saxon_dr#3806,14-May-18 09:15 PM,yeah same ethan,
efank#9753,14-May-18 09:15 PM,and how tought it is,
Snowfish#4289,14-May-18 09:15 PM,i feel like im getting whipped around on a leash by the adminsitration as an undergrad,
Snowfish#4289,14-May-18 09:15 PM,grad programs seem lit,
Snowfish#4289,14-May-18 09:15 PM,but jesus christ undergrad is annoying',
saxon_dr#3806,14-May-18 09:15 PM,"i was like ""wow man i really didn't do shit in high school. i hope college is hard so i can get my shit together""",
efank#9753,14-May-18 09:15 PM,fair enough i guess that's different,
efank#9753,14-May-18 09:16 PM,yes same julian,
efank#9753,14-May-18 09:16 PM,"snowfish, it's more resentment",
efank#9753,14-May-18 09:16 PM,at like admin politics then?,
efank#9753,14-May-18 09:16 PM,"tbf though, isn't that always the case",
efank#9753,14-May-18 09:16 PM,undergrad is always an afterthought in comparsion to grad,
bopas2#1774,14-May-18 09:16 PM,"Snowfish, you're graduating early correct?",
efank#9753,14-May-18 09:16 PM,yah snowfish is iirc,
saxon_dr#3806,14-May-18 09:16 PM,oh when are you graduating,

efank#9753,14-May-18 09:20 PM,smart.gatech.edu/,
MooshRum#3936,14-May-18 09:20 PM,They are the same as anything,
MooshRum#3936,14-May-18 09:20 PM,Except they baby you into like events,
MooshRum#3936,14-May-18 09:20 PM,to meet people,
Snowfish#4289,14-May-18 09:20 PM,like the honors program?,
MooshRum#3936,14-May-18 09:20 PM,and EXPERIENCE,
efank#9753,14-May-18 09:20 PM,it's an honor sprogram?,
MooshRum#3936,14-May-18 09:20 PM,No,
Snowfish#4289,14-May-18 09:20 PM,no there's something literally called the honors program,
Snowfish#4289,14-May-18 09:20 PM,which is basically nothing,
efank#9753,14-May-18 09:20 PM,lol,
Snowfish#4289,14-May-18 09:20 PM,before we got on this tangent,
MooshRum#3936,14-May-18 09:20 PM,The Smart living thing is like literally nothing,
MooshRum#3936,14-May-18 09:21 PM,they just want extra money out of you,
Snowfish#4289,14-May-18 09:21 PM,yea i hold resentment toward the administration politics,
Snowfish#4289,14-May-18 09:21 PM,most of my complaints are about that,
efank#9753,14-May-18 09:21 PM,^,
bopas2#1774,14-May-18 09:21 PM,Any advice for incoming freshmen on that topic?,
saxon_dr#3806,14-May-18 09:21 PM,welp isn't that just a part of being a student :k3llyShrug:,
Caw#1913,14-May-18 09:21 PM,Hey can we attempt the E&M placement test at tech even if we didnt take the AP exam?,
saxon_dr#3806,14-May-18 09:21 PM,are you really a student if you like the school administration,
MooshRum#3936,14-May-18 09:21 PM,Dont sign up for smart,
MooshRum#3936,14-May-18 09:21 PM,and save your 400 dollars,
Snowfish#4289,14-May-18 09:22 PM,"i think that the school has a really good community and atmosphere, i just think that a really bad side effect of the administration is that it makes classes difficult for no reason and strangles the schedules and flexibility of a bunch of majors",
efank#9753,14-May-18 09:22 PM,i got invited to it,
efank#9753,14-May-18 09:22 PM,but i bet,
efank#9753,14-May-18 09:22 PM,its' a money grab,
MooshRum#3936,14-May-18 09:22 PM,It's less the administrations and more of the boards of each college are ass,
Snowfish#4289,14-May-18 09:22 PM,that's the SAME thing u GOOF,
MooshRum#3936,14-May-18 09:22 PM,not entirely,
MooshRum#3936,14-May-18 09:22 PM,they make stupid curriculums,
Snowfish#4289,14-May-18 09:22 PM,its a blanket term,
efank#9753,14-May-18 09:22 PM,@Caw#1913  nto sure,

efank#9753,14-May-18 09:23 PM,@Caw#1913  i'd think they'd let you,
saxon_dr#3806,14-May-18 09:23 PM,well as far as students are concerned they're the same thing,
Snowfish#4289,14-May-18 09:23 PM,you have to have a **4** on the exam to take placement,
Snowfish#4289,14-May-18 09:23 PM,nothing else,
Caw#1913,14-May-18 09:23 PM,I didn't know if you had to get a 4 to qualify,
efank#9753,14-May-18 09:23 PM,"@Caw#1913  not sure, ohh whoops",
saxon_dr#3806,14-May-18 09:23 PM,like idrc if it's coming from the board or the head of school,
Snowfish#4289,14-May-18 09:23 PM,you have to have exactly a 4,
Caw#1913,14-May-18 09:23 PM,Like is the exam the qualifier to take it? Or could you just sign up to take it without that,
MooshRum#3936,14-May-18 09:23 PM,No,
MooshRum#3936,14-May-18 09:23 PM,You had to take AP physics and get a 4,
saxon_dr#3806,14-May-18 09:23 PM,no you take the exam so you don't have to take the class,
MooshRum#3936,14-May-18 09:23 PM,to take the qualifier exam,
Caw#1913,14-May-18 09:24 PM,Welp rip,
mic#7575,14-May-18 09:24 PM,do you know if UChicago’s grade deflation is worse? not that I actually know anything about UChicago,
saxon_dr#3806,14-May-18 09:24 PM,did you not take it cawald,
Snowfish#4289,14-May-18 09:24 PM,no fucking idea,
Snowfish#4289,14-May-18 09:24 PM,i just know GT is one of if not the worst,
saxon_dr#3806,14-May-18 09:25 PM,i just know that the people there are either super into studying or miserable every day,
Caw#1913,14-May-18 09:25 PM,No I only did mech,
Caw#1913,14-May-18 09:25 PM,I debated on doing e&m this year but I thought I would be able to take the placement test,
saxon_dr#3806,14-May-18 09:25 PM,this is from my friend that actually is going to chicago next year,
MooshRum#3936,14-May-18 09:25 PM,You probably wouldnt pass it without taking the class either way @Caw#1913,
Samsung#6949,14-May-18 09:25 PM,oof I just caught up in this chat and I am definitely skipping Phys1 and 2 now,
Caw#1913,14-May-18 09:25 PM,Yah I didn't think I would but it would be worth a shot,
saxon_dr#3806,14-May-18 09:25 PM,samsung did you get 5s,
Samsung#6949,14-May-18 09:25 PM,yah,
MooshRum#3936,14-May-18 09:26 PM,oh youre a physics major,
MooshRum#3936,14-May-18 09:26 PM,"Oooo,, idk about skipping",
Samsung#6949,14-May-18 09:26 PM,lol for now,
Snowfish#4289,14-May-18 09:26 PM,no just fucking skip it,
Samsung#6949,14-May-18 09:26 PM,I'm thinking about just switching to MechE anyways but Im not sure,
MooshRum#3936,14-May-18 09:26 PM,My physics majors friends hated their life for skipping phys 1 and 2,
MooshRum#3936,14-May-18 09:26 PM,they were not prepared for higher physics,
Snowfish#4289,14-May-18 09:26 PM,i knew like 2 in freshman year and they didnt even mention it,
Snowfish#4289,14-May-18 09:26 PM,but this is anecdotal,
Samsung#6949,14-May-18 09:27 PM,I mean I'm trying to take some online courses in higher physics rn but yeah I imagine its brutal,
Snowfish#4289,14-May-18 09:27 PM,"at the very least, fitting labs into your schedule is dogshit",
MooshRum#3936,14-May-18 09:27 PM,AP physics doesnt teach you nearly enough to compare with GT's phyics programs,
Samsung#6949,14-May-18 09:27 PM,I think the next course I'd have to take is like Classical Mech 1 or something,
Samsung#6949,14-May-18 09:27 PM,Or Classical Physics,
MooshRum#3936,14-May-18 09:28 PM,"Some people love classical, some hate it",
Samsung#6949,14-May-18 09:29 PM,"Yeah. If I do switch majors my physics requirements are already done, but if not then I have to grind for that course",
Samsung#6949,14-May-18 09:30 PM,Anyone taking that French test tomorrow tho? lol,
Le Noir DragooN#8434,14-May-18 09:36 PM,i'm kinda forced to be in the smart llc,
Le Noir DragooN#8434,14-May-18 09:36 PM,cuz it's a requirement for a scholarship,
Le Noir DragooN#8434,14-May-18 09:37 PM,but the requirement holds that one should be part of the smart llc for freshman year,
Snowfish#4289,14-May-18 09:37 PM,that sucks,

joazlazer#2041,15-May-18 12:51 PM,which form @kk4jrq#5652 ?,
joazlazer#2041,15-May-18 12:52 PM,if it was xln(1+x/3) I just multiplied the series by x and substituted in x/3 for x,
kk4jrq#5652,15-May-18 12:53 PM,That's what I did... Cool,
kk4jrq#5652,15-May-18 12:53 PM,I started taking the derivative lol.  That got messy fast,
joazlazer#2041,15-May-18 12:53 PM,yikes,
kk4jrq#5652,15-May-18 12:56 PM,I made it to the 3rd derivative then I realized how dumb I am lol,

Caw#1913,15-May-18 06:01 PM,Yep,
Caw#1913,15-May-18 06:02 PM,It took me so long to write that out,
Caw#1913,15-May-18 06:02 PM,Because I had the general form wrong for a little bit,
Caw#1913,15-May-18 06:03 PM,And I tried every test I could think of,
joazlazer#2041,15-May-18 06:04 PM,ah,
Caw#1913,15-May-18 06:04 PM,I'm never confident in my substitutions into the series,
Caw#1913,15-May-18 06:04 PM,So I had to write out the derivative to find the patterns and general form,
joazlazer#2041,15-May-18 06:05 PM,"so did you chose to find the interval of convergence for ln(1+x) and substitute into the convergence interval?, or did you find the interval of convergence for xln(1+x/3) directly? I chose the latter",

saxon_dr#3806,15-May-18 06:34 PM,brainfked me,
saxon_dr#3806,15-May-18 06:34 PM,i think i did it right at first,
saxon_dr#3806,15-May-18 06:34 PM,and then thought i did it wrong,
saxon_dr#3806,15-May-18 06:34 PM,so changed it,
saxon_dr#3806,15-May-18 06:34 PM,and then realized it wasn't wrong,
saxon_dr#3806,15-May-18 06:34 PM,and asked for an extra sheet to do it,

Tempelina#0898,16-May-18 07:48 AM,Mhm,
efank#9753,16-May-18 07:48 AM,i'm at a school that offers both (i guess you could guess from me having taken only 1 IB),
Tempelina#0898,16-May-18 07:48 AM,Yeah I have 7 IB classes including ToK,
Tempelina#0898,16-May-18 07:49 AM,So 6 exams I gotta take,

efank#9753,16-May-18 07:51 AM,i was under the idea IB is very rare in the US,
Tempelina#0898,16-May-18 07:52 AM,The fact that my entire school system encouraged it greatly and I was smart enough to do it and not die (too badly),

Masasasaki#1911,16-May-18 12:49 PM,I thought the frq was a lot easier than the mc tbh,

joazlazer#2041,16-May-18 12:56 PM,do you do that integral,
joazlazer#2041,16-May-18 12:56 PM,i thought it was arcsec,

joazlazer#2041,16-May-18 12:57 PM,how are we supposed to get that on the test ^^^,
joazlazer#2041,16-May-18 12:58 PM,also yeah i put arcsin too,
joazlazer#2041,16-May-18 12:58 PM,because it couldn't have been arctan,
Masasasaki#1911,16-May-18 12:58 PM,You do trig sug,
Masasasaki#1911,16-May-18 12:58 PM,*sub,
joazlazer#2041,16-May-18 12:58 PM,thats not a bc technique is it,
Masasasaki#1911,16-May-18 12:58 PM,Like you get root(2x - x^2 + 1 - 1),
Masasasaki#1911,16-May-18 12:58 PM,So it’s a perfect square,
Masasasaki#1911,16-May-18 12:59 PM,Really? We learned trig sub in our class,
joazlazer#2041,16-May-18 12:59 PM,I never actually took BC,
bopas2#1774,16-May-18 12:59 PM,"We did too, I just did guess and check tho",

Quantum#1480,16-May-18 07:55 PM,Lol it was an entire FRQ for me last year,
Cole#0059,16-May-18 08:03 PM,I learned it in Calc 3,
Cole#0059,16-May-18 08:04 PM,an entire FRQ? are you talking about the BC exam cause I did not get that FRQ,
mic#7575,16-May-18 08:04 PM,how easy is the FASET registration? could I go to the bathroom during class and do it in on my phone in five minutes?,

Please note 2-3 dates that would work for your summer schedule when signing up for FASET., , **Whether FASET 1 or FASET 7, each student will have equal access to classes.**, Our program works closely with the Registrar and each Georgia Tech Academic College to ensure that each FASET session offers a similar number of classes and seats throughout the summer. The Institute opens classes in waves throughout the summer so all students have an equal chance at desired classes. But note that no class is guaranteed for any student., , **If you do not attend FASET, your class registration will open following FASET 7.**, FASET is not a mandatory event, but students who attend FASET register for their first term classes during their session. Those choosing not to attend FASET are required to wait until the end of FASET 7 for their registration time ticket to open., , **Though some sessions are recommended for certain programs or students, no session is guaranteed.**, Often certain programs recommend students to register for a specific FASET session to assist in their scheduling. However, no session is guaranteed. To ensure you reserve a spot in a recommended session, we strongly encourage you to register for your session at your earliest convenience., , **The day and week FASET registration opens is the busiest time in our office.**, We understand that you may have questions or concerns regarding FASET and the registration process and our goal is answer each of those. There are multiple ways to connect with us, but the most efficient way to do so is by email. Our phone lines may be full when you call, but there is always someone checking our email account during our office hours, especially during this peak time.",

Samsung#6949,17-May-18 09:14 AM,I feel like there's a specific process that's supposed to happen,
Samsung#6949,17-May-18 09:14 AM,Do the teachers at your school proctor the exams?,
Samsung#6949,17-May-18 09:14 AM,"If so, ask one of them first",
efank#9753,17-May-18 09:21 AM,is my fault though,
pnw#8833,17-May-18 09:21 AM,samsung,
efank#9753,17-May-18 09:21 AM,things is the proctor,
pnw#8833,17-May-18 09:21 AM,how to regisrter?,
efank#9753,17-May-18 09:21 AM,already screwed up a few of the procedures,
efank#9753,17-May-18 09:21 AM,during the exam,
efank#9753,17-May-18 09:21 AM,so like that's why I got confused slightly,
efank#9753,17-May-18 09:21 AM,idk crap,
Masasasaki#1911,17-May-18 09:22 AM,Maybe ask your ap c teacher and see what they can do for you?,
efank#9753,17-May-18 09:22 AM,@Samsung#6949 yeah I just sent the teacher that acts as the coordinator,
Masasasaki#1911,17-May-18 09:22 AM,You just have to tell someone lol,

Samsung#6949,17-May-18 09:23 AM,"@pnw#8833 idk, they just sent me an email saying I was now eligible for the last 2 fasets",
Samsung#6949,17-May-18 09:24 AM,"I'm out of state and one of their emails said I could only do 1-5, I was just following up on that",
Samsung#6949,17-May-18 09:25 AM,I'm sure they have protocols in place for it @efank#9753,
Masasasaki#1911,17-May-18 09:28 AM,The sign up is gonna be on buzzport right?,

pwn#8182,17-May-18 12:03 PM,Is it a super hard class? Im considering doing massive self studying for the sat subject test and useing my score to test out if its weedout class,
themoosegoose#5243,17-May-18 12:05 PM,You should try to exempt it,
pwn#8182,17-May-18 12:07 PM,How hard is it,
themoosegoose#5243,17-May-18 12:07 PM,The subject test or,
pwn#8182,17-May-18 12:07 PM,Self studying chem in 2 weeks would be very difficult for me and might mean lower grades in my real classes,
pwn#8182,17-May-18 12:07 PM,The class,
themoosegoose#5243,17-May-18 12:08 PM,Bc im a first year,
bopas2#1774,17-May-18 12:08 PM,"does GT even allow you to skip classes solely based on test score, or do they require you to actually take the respective class in conjunction with the test?",
themoosegoose#5243,17-May-18 12:08 PM,Subject test was rather easy,
themoosegoose#5243,17-May-18 12:08 PM,Big curve,

pwn#8182,17-May-18 12:10 PM,Im only trying to test out of it if its like overly hard,
pwn#8182,17-May-18 12:10 PM,Because takeing would be good for my knowledge,
pwn#8182,17-May-18 12:12 PM,Is it known as a class that most people dont get good grades in?,

Snowfish#4289,17-May-18 12:57 PM,i'd say anything below a 3.0 is below average,
pwn#8182,17-May-18 12:57 PM,No im asking if the classes average is bad,
pwn#8182,17-May-18 12:58 PM,Compared to others,
Snowfish#4289,17-May-18 12:58 PM,yeah its below 3.0,
Snowfish#4289,17-May-18 12:58 PM,sorry,

saxon_dr#3806,17-May-18 05:19 PM,is buzzport something you need to setup?,
saxon_dr#3806,17-May-18 05:20 PM,cuz it says incorrect username and password combination whenever i do it,
Lennox#3038,17-May-18 05:21 PM,I think so,
Lennox#3038,17-May-18 05:21 PM,I have to login with different a different username and password from the admissions page,
Snowfish#4289,17-May-18 05:22 PM,wtf,
Snowfish#4289,17-May-18 05:22 PM,werid,
Lennox#3038,17-May-18 05:23 PM,You have to use your username given by gt,
Lennox#3038,17-May-18 05:24 PM,it'll be like jgu4 or something,
Lennox#3038,17-May-18 05:24 PM,"first letter of your first name, last name, and a number",
8726andrew#5709,17-May-18 05:24 PM,I’ve always had to do that,
8726andrew#5709,17-May-18 05:25 PM,Admissions used my personal email and not my gt one for some reason,
Rye#0666,17-May-18 06:42 PM,How is CHEM 1310 if I already took AP Chem sophomore year?,
Nobo#2748,17-May-18 10:13 PM,"@8726andrew#5709 if admissions had your personal email registered prior to them going through and activating accounts, they sometimes list that as your temp primary point of contact 😄",
Nobo#2748,17-May-18 10:13 PM,it'll change eventually to your gatech email,
8726andrew#5709,17-May-18 10:13 PM,Idk lol I’ve had a gatech email since August and I applied in october,
8726andrew#5709,17-May-18 10:14 PM,I guess they just default to the email you apply with or something,
Nobo#2748,17-May-18 10:15 PM,"@Rye#0666 Chem 1310 is basically ***""Witness the strength of random groups as they fight to protecc their GPAs, as they suffer from the combined fate of being unable to directly impact their own grade in lab assignments under the sway of the congenital defects of the Great Wild Fourth Group Member""***",
Nobo#2748,17-May-18 10:16 PM,"TL;DR:, 1) Can you do basic intro Chem stuff (since you took AP Chem you'll be fine if you study and refresh, there's some new material but it builds upon what you know), 2) When you first form lab groups, if allowed to form groups please sit with people you either A) know and trust or B) appear social and willing to pull their weight",
Nobo#2748,17-May-18 10:18 PM,"@Rye#0666 , Just make sure that you synergize with your group mates since typically (unless the TAs decide otherwise) having a good group for the semester means less headaches when you have to finish your labs out of class",
Nobo#2748,17-May-18 10:18 PM,"Also study for tests still even if it's material you learned previously - small mistakes suck, esp. after like 50 multiple choice questions",
Nobo#2748,17-May-18 10:19 PM,but the answers are all similar to the third decimal,
pnw#8833,17-May-18 10:19 PM,@Nobo#2748  did u take chem 1310,

pnw#8833,17-May-18 10:21 PM,"I've never taken AP Chem, but i know if i study for the subject test the next two weeks i can test out of it, but that would me haveing a lot less fun with my friends before senior year is over and possibly negletvginh my real schoolwork and haveing it drop, is chem 1310 a really bad weedout class to where it's worth?",
8726andrew#5709,17-May-18 10:21 PM,I’ve heard it’s one of the big weedout classes,
pnw#8833,17-May-18 10:22 PM,neglecting*,
unahb#8581,17-May-18 10:22 PM,chem isnt too hard right?,
unahb#8581,17-May-18 10:22 PM,i took ap chem but not the test,
Nobo#2748,17-May-18 10:22 PM,**alright listen up bois and gurls about the cancer that are the three/four Cs**,
unahb#8581,17-May-18 10:22 PM,so ill have to take chem anyway,
Nobo#2748,17-May-18 10:22 PM,"the short answer: On their own, the courses are not too bad",
unahb#8581,17-May-18 10:22 PM,what are the 3/4 c's,
Nobo#2748,17-May-18 10:23 PM,"As the baseline freshmen-level courses (alongside your major-specific intro courses), they have a metric fuk ton of work and time required to invest in",
saxon_dr#3806,17-May-18 10:23 PM,but the cs ones are not bad right?,
Nobo#2748,17-May-18 10:23 PM,"typically across most Engineering majors:, Computer Science, Calc (math), Chem/Physics",
pnw#8833,17-May-18 10:23 PM,"my other big fear is that if i test of chem 1310 useing a subject test score,  I wont have really learned any chem",
pnw#8833,17-May-18 10:24 PM,the subject test is majorly eaiser than the class,
pnw#8833,17-May-18 10:24 PM,im assuming,
Nobo#2748,17-May-18 10:24 PM,"They're not **bad separately**, they're bad ***together***.",
Nobo#2748,17-May-18 10:24 PM,because of how time-consuming they are,
unahb#8581,17-May-18 10:24 PM,do you need an 800 to get out of classes with subject tests?,
MEE6#4876,17-May-18 10:24 PM,"GG @unahb#8581, you just advanced to level 1!",
8726andrew#5709,17-May-18 10:24 PM,Personally only worry about that if you’re in a chem relevant major,
pnw#8833,17-May-18 10:24 PM,no,
pnw#8833,17-May-18 10:24 PM,Chem is you neeed a 730,
unahb#8581,17-May-18 10:24 PM,physics?,
pnw#8833,17-May-18 10:24 PM,they dont do it for physics,
unahb#8581,17-May-18 10:24 PM,oh ok,
pnw#8833,17-May-18 10:24 PM,"only chem, history, and maybe 1 other thing",
saxon_dr#3806,17-May-18 10:24 PM,well i heard the cs freshman courses are really ez and i have 5 in chem and phys so i don't have to take those i think,
8726andrew#5709,17-May-18 10:24 PM,There’s a physics subject test but it has weird stuff on it,
unahb#8581,17-May-18 10:24 PM,i have a 4 on the ap test,
Nobo#2748,17-May-18 10:24 PM,"Physics I isnt particularly bad, most people even test out or skip",
Nobo#2748,17-May-18 10:25 PM,Physics two is the divide,
unahb#8581,17-May-18 10:25 PM,you can test out?,
Nobo#2748,17-May-18 10:25 PM,certain combinations of AP scores,
unahb#8581,17-May-18 10:25 PM,wym,
8726andrew#5709,17-May-18 10:25 PM,Ap physics c gives you credit for 2211 and 2212 if you get a 5 on both,
Nobo#2748,17-May-18 10:25 PM,since Physics at GT is a bit more,
unahb#8581,17-May-18 10:25 PM,wait lemme dm i have so many questions,
Nobo#2748,17-May-18 10:25 PM,yeah,
pnw#8833,17-May-18 10:25 PM,can u test out during FASET by takeing the final,
Nobo#2748,17-May-18 10:25 PM,🤔,
saxon_dr#3806,17-May-18 10:25 PM,4 on the AP phys c makes you eligible to take the test,
8726andrew#5709,17-May-18 10:25 PM,Physics 1 and 2 are just elective physics credit tho,
Nobo#2748,17-May-18 10:26 PM,"***TL;DR: Don't try to overachieve in your first goddamn semester, that's how you die***",
pnw#8833,17-May-18 10:26 PM,so it'd def worth trying to get out of chem 1310 even if it means major studying,
pnw#8833,17-May-18 10:26 PM,rn,
8726andrew#5709,17-May-18 10:26 PM,You’re ae so I’d say for sure yeah,
saxon_dr#3806,17-May-18 10:26 PM,wait so if i have 5 on chem phys and cs as a cs major what do i take,
pnw#8833,17-May-18 10:26 PM,if i start doing that and my real grades drop,
pnw#8833,17-May-18 10:26 PM,what's the chance i get recinded,
8726andrew#5709,17-May-18 10:27 PM,Bro it’s like the end of senior year how much can you possibly do,
saxon_dr#3806,17-May-18 10:27 PM,also the phys test is apparently really hard,
Lennox#3038,17-May-18 10:27 PM,so sayeth the wise snowfish,
pnw#8833,17-May-18 10:27 PM,i've had 4.0 up until now and im gona end up getting ~a 3.0 for my 2nd senior year,
pnw#8833,17-May-18 10:27 PM,unless i start doing major work,
pnw#8833,17-May-18 10:27 PM,is that grounds for recinded,
8726andrew#5709,17-May-18 10:28 PM,My teacher for c was saying that if we don’t get 5s on both exams then try to take the test to get credit bc the content is like basically the same,
8726andrew#5709,17-May-18 10:28 PM,He had people who got 4s score well enough to get credit iirc,
8726andrew#5709,17-May-18 10:28 PM,So it’s worth trying,
saxon_dr#3806,17-May-18 10:28 PM,yeah the phys test is super hard but you should still try it,
saxon_dr#3806,17-May-18 10:28 PM,there is no downside,
saxon_dr#3806,17-May-18 10:28 PM,if you don't pass you just take the course that you woulda be taking without it anyway,
8726andrew#5709,17-May-18 10:29 PM,If you’re worried about getting rescinded email admissions maybe?,
saxon_dr#3806,17-May-18 10:29 PM,that and ask your school counselor,
Nobo#2748,17-May-18 10:36 PM,"If you already got accepted, Georgia Tech ***rarely ever rescinds their letter***.",
Nobo#2748,17-May-18 10:37 PM,"They only withdraw their offer if:, 1) You have a significant GPA drop i.e. you fail legit half your courses or something abnormal, drop out of high school, etc, 2) You do something that goes against general civil principle i.e. you go ahead and stab someone 47 times in the chest, 3) You withdraw first",
Nobo#2748,17-May-18 10:38 PM,"TBH, admissions just is waiting for the contact back from the HS that you graduated and everything seems okie dokie",
8726andrew#5709,17-May-18 10:38 PM,What about 46 times though,
Nobo#2748,17-May-18 10:38 PM,debatable,
8726andrew#5709,17-May-18 10:38 PM,Like that’s okay right,
Nobo#2748,17-May-18 10:38 PM,going to have to ask the student supreme court,

Nobo#2748,17-May-18 10:40 PM,I also only witnessed a single time where someone I knew threw another person out the second floor window,
unahb#8581,17-May-18 10:40 PM,or willl they know,
Nobo#2748,17-May-18 10:41 PM,here's a better response to your question,
Nobo#2748,17-May-18 10:41 PM,Georgia Tech OIT/ResNet (renamed WreckTechs but that names kind of iffy) is a registered ISP,
Nobo#2748,17-May-18 10:41 PM,"just like Verizon/AT&T/etc, they only care if they get notified",
Nobo#2748,17-May-18 10:42 PM,i.e. you can torrent and run servers and do whatever you want,
unahb#8581,17-May-18 10:42 PM,"oh ok, so doing something greyhat wont get me in trouble, only black hat stuff",
Nobo#2748,17-May-18 10:42 PM,"but as soon as some company (looking at you Pearson) complains to GT, GT will have to step in",
Nobo#2748,17-May-18 10:42 PM,because theyre legally obligated to,
unahb#8581,17-May-18 10:42 PM,anyone ever try to ddos the school?,
Nobo#2748,17-May-18 10:43 PM,we're talking about infrastructure literally second only to the Pentagon,
Nobo#2748,17-May-18 10:43 PM,the answer is yes,
Nobo#2748,17-May-18 10:43 PM,whether it works is 99% no,
unahb#8581,17-May-18 10:43 PM,really? oof,
Nobo#2748,17-May-18 10:43 PM,GT internet only goes down when GT themselves fuck up,
unahb#8581,17-May-18 10:43 PM,probably small botnets,
Nobo#2748,17-May-18 10:44 PM,GT runs numerous honeypots and there are several deeplearning and programming research teams that operate through GT's network,
unahb#8581,17-May-18 10:44 PM,oh,
Nobo#2748,17-May-18 10:44 PM,TL;DR: Your internet speeds are only limited by your own hardware,
unahb#8581,17-May-18 10:45 PM,oh nice nice,
Nobo#2748,17-May-18 10:45 PM,"just make sure you do you on your own devices, no farming cryptocurrency or running bot ops on their virtual desktops or something",

unahb#8581,17-May-18 10:45 PM,ok,
Nobo#2748,17-May-18 10:46 PM,dont set fire to GT physical desktops or something,
unahb#8581,17-May-18 10:46 PM,farming waste of time anyway,
Nobo#2748,17-May-18 10:46 PM,I know that someone tried to do that and got jebaited by GT so yeah,
Nobo#2748,17-May-18 10:46 PM,but its against policy to install mass amounts of your own programs across all the library/virtual machines,
Nobo#2748,17-May-18 10:47 PM,you can install things on your on virtual machine assigned to your gatech login tho,

pnw#8833,22-May-18 12:32 AM,my reason is that i decided to not focus on schoolwork and instead used 2nd semester to self study for 5 AP tests of classes i wasnt in,
MEE6#4876,22-May-18 12:32 AM,"GG @pnw#8833, you just advanced to level 5!",

waffle.dynasty#2740,22-May-18 12:33 AM,I had a friend last year get 2 D's and no A' s and Purdue didn't say anything,
joazlazer#2041,22-May-18 12:33 AM,as OOS tbh i feel you,
Caw#1913,22-May-18 12:33 AM,How many hours of credit will you have Miliad?,
Caw#1913,22-May-18 12:33 AM,OOS sucks,
pnw#8833,22-May-18 12:33 AM,if i passed,
pnw#8833,22-May-18 12:33 AM,a lot,
Caw#1913,22-May-18 12:33 AM,If you get 5's,
pnw#8833,22-May-18 12:33 AM,enough to be a sophmore,
Caw#1913,22-May-18 12:33 AM,Hey you're in the same boat as me,
pnw#8833,22-May-18 12:34 AM,i hadn't taken many AP's before this year,
pnw#8833,22-May-18 12:34 AM,so i mad took so  many,
Caw#1913,22-May-18 12:34 AM,"I have a spread sheet of a schedule to graduate in 3 years with AE if you want it, not planning on doing it any more but if you want it",
Caw#1913,22-May-18 12:34 AM,Could be useful for organizing,
pnw#8833,22-May-18 12:34 AM,is it with or without AP credit,
Caw#1913,22-May-18 12:34 AM,With some AP's,
pnw#8833,22-May-18 12:34 AM,wait am i dumb,
Caw#1913,22-May-18 12:34 AM,You could fill in what you have,
Caw#1913,22-May-18 12:35 AM,Here I'll send it to you and you can look over it,
pnw#8833,22-May-18 12:35 AM,yea that'd be great,
Caw#1913,22-May-18 12:35 AM,I decided against it but I understand why you would want to if you're paying the full OOS,
Caw#1913,22-May-18 12:35 AM,You have excel or do you want google sheets?,
pnw#8833,22-May-18 12:36 AM,either,
pnw#8833,22-May-18 12:36 AM,you know what's great about tech,
Caw#1913,22-May-18 12:36 AM,Alright,
pnw#8833,22-May-18 12:36 AM,u can get out of calsses with SAT subject tests,
pnw#8833,22-May-18 12:36 AM,so now im mad studying for those,
waffle.dynasty#2740,22-May-18 12:37 AM,Tech honestly has some of the most generous AP credit policies around,
pnw#8833,22-May-18 12:38 AM,i dont like that they dont have college exams tho,
joazlazer#2041,22-May-18 12:38 AM,no credit for AP ~~Calculator~~ Statistics tho... probably would have self studied that otherwise,
joazlazer#2041,22-May-18 12:38 AM,also wym college exams?,
Quantum#1480,22-May-18 12:39 AM,do you mean placement exams?,
pnw#8833,22-May-18 12:39 AM,"my state school (university of washington), has a day called test day.",
pnw#8833,22-May-18 12:39 AM,you take the finals for any classes,
pnw#8833,22-May-18 12:39 AM,not even finals just exams,
pnw#8833,22-May-18 12:39 AM,and get out of them,
Caw#1913,22-May-18 12:39 AM,>AP Calculator,
Caw#1913,22-May-18 12:39 AM,How am I just now hearing this,
joazlazer#2041,22-May-18 12:39 AM,i mean tbh,
Caw#1913,22-May-18 12:39 AM,It really was,
joazlazer#2041,22-May-18 12:40 AM,they have math placements @pnw#8833 https://www.math.gatech.edu/optional-gt-advanced-placement-mathematics-examinations,
joazlazer#2041,22-May-18 12:40 AM,though I dont want to stress you into studing Linear Algebra over the summer,
pnw#8833,22-May-18 12:41 AM,i might,
pnw#8833,22-May-18 12:41 AM,but it's dumb that they dont have them for all topics,
Quantum#1480,22-May-18 12:41 AM,What do you plan on majoring in?,
pnw#8833,22-May-18 12:41 AM,im Aero E,
Quantum#1480,22-May-18 12:42 AM,I'd ask a current AE major how important Linear Algebra is,
Quantum#1480,22-May-18 12:42 AM,Because I know in CS a strong foundation in Linear Algebra is really important,
Caw#1913,22-May-18 12:43 AM,I think the biggest part from linear in AE is just working with matricies,
Caw#1913,22-May-18 12:43 AM,I dunno though,
joazlazer#2041,22-May-18 12:43 AM,what even *are* grids of numbers?,
joazlazer#2041,22-May-18 12:43 AM,:Thonk_transparent:,
waffle.dynasty#2740,22-May-18 12:44 AM,Linear is only 2 credit hours,
waffle.dynasty#2740,22-May-18 12:44 AM,It's not as important as diff as for AE,
Caw#1913,22-May-18 12:44 AM,https://www.quora.com/How-is-linear-algebra-applied-in-the-aerospace-industry,
Caw#1913,22-May-18 12:44 AM,I'm definitely going to try and study Linear over the summer while I'm at tech,
joazlazer#2041,22-May-18 12:46 AM,ok ok ok so i just found out we have a new emote,
joazlazer#2041,22-May-18 12:46 AM,:evilpatrick:,
Caw#1913,22-May-18 12:46 AM,Hmm thought that one was old,
joazlazer#2041,22-May-18 12:46 AM,wait really,
Caw#1913,22-May-18 12:46 AM,Maybe not,
Caw#1913,22-May-18 12:46 AM,Marissa probably knows,
pnw#8833,22-May-18 12:46 AM,yo,
pnw#8833,22-May-18 12:46 AM,what should i study te summer before i get to tech,
pnw#8833,22-May-18 12:47 AM,"should i pick a class, get the textbook, and read now",
Caw#1913,22-May-18 12:47 AM,If you're trying to graduate fast honestly linear would probably be best,
Caw#1913,22-May-18 12:47 AM,Doesn't seem too bad and it lets you take 2551 and 2552,
pnw#8833,22-May-18 12:47 AM,I'm mainly worried that my HS didn't prepare me for college and that I need to get a basic understanding of HS level topcis,
pnw#8833,22-May-18 12:47 AM,i go to a really bad school,
Caw#1913,22-May-18 12:48 AM,Hmmm,
Caw#1913,22-May-18 12:48 AM,How bad?,
pnw#8833,22-May-18 12:48 AM,very bad,
pnw#8833,22-May-18 12:48 AM,like majoirt dont go to college,
Caw#1913,22-May-18 12:48 AM,Oh wow,
joazlazer#2041,22-May-18 12:48 AM,yikes,
pnw#8833,22-May-18 12:48 AM,i think it's more like 41% don't but yea,
pnw#8833,22-May-18 12:48 AM,something like that,
pnw#8833,22-May-18 12:49 AM,"out of the 600 graudating class, im the only one not going to my state school,community college, or not going to college",
joazlazer#2041,22-May-18 12:49 AM,dang thats crazy,
joazlazer#2041,22-May-18 12:49 AM,also thats a huge class,
pnw#8833,22-May-18 12:49 AM,yea,
pnw#8833,22-May-18 12:50 AM,im super worried about college,
pnw#8833,22-May-18 12:50 AM,ima need to catch up on real highschool material,
joazlazer#2041,22-May-18 12:50 AM,i mean if you were able to understand diff and integral calculus,
joazlazer#2041,22-May-18 12:50 AM,your HS maths are probably more than adequate,
Nobo#2748,22-May-18 12:51 AM,the real magic of AE is being required to take Classical Physics II instead of Modern kappa,
Caw#1913,22-May-18 12:51 AM,"And even if you needed help, there are tons at people at Tech who would be willing to help you",
pnw#8833,22-May-18 12:51 AM,my hs doesnt have calc past AB and i couldnt take the AB class because it's litearlly the same period as senior english (great planning),
pnw#8833,22-May-18 12:51 AM,but i self studied calc BC,
pnw#8833,22-May-18 12:51 AM,pretty sure i got a solid 5,
Caw#1913,22-May-18 12:52 AM,Then you'll be fine,
pnw#8833,22-May-18 12:52 AM,never touched diff tho,
Caw#1913,22-May-18 12:52 AM,If you felt confident from self-studying,
Caw#1913,22-May-18 12:52 AM,Well BC touches on diff a little bit,
pnw#8833,22-May-18 12:52 AM,only 1 method,
joazlazer#2041,22-May-18 12:52 AM,I mean,
Caw#1913,22-May-18 12:53 AM,But the thing is no one else would have that either,
Caw#1913,22-May-18 12:53 AM,So you don't have to worry,
joazlazer#2041,22-May-18 12:53 AM,"Logistics, Seperable, Eulers Method, Slope Field",
Caw#1913,22-May-18 12:53 AM,No one in HS takes a full on diff course,
pnw#8833,22-May-18 12:53 AM,oh okay,
Caw#1913,22-May-18 12:53 AM,So you won't be at a disadvantage,
pnw#8833,22-May-18 12:53 AM,for a second i thought they did,
pnw#8833,22-May-18 12:53 AM,lmfao,
Caw#1913,22-May-18 12:53 AM,lol no,
Caw#1913,22-May-18 12:53 AM,I wish,
pnw#8833,22-May-18 12:53 AM,i dont know what to expect,
joazlazer#2041,22-May-18 12:54 AM,"while there are tons of people who have taken tons of AP classes in HS, there are also a lot of people that havent",
saxon_dr#3806,22-May-18 12:54 AM,"what the, 259 new messages",
joazlazer#2041,22-May-18 12:54 AM,and the fact that you were able to (*presumably*) successfully self study quite a few APs speaks to your drive and study skills,
Caw#1913,22-May-18 12:54 AM,Also 55% of the students are from in state,
pnw#8833,22-May-18 12:54 AM,watch me get all 1's,
pnw#8833,22-May-18 12:54 AM,lmfao,
Caw#1913,22-May-18 12:54 AM,Which is less competitive than OOS,
joazlazer#2041,22-May-18 12:55 AM,^^ good point,
joazlazer#2041,22-May-18 12:55 AM,if you got in OOS,
Caw#1913,22-May-18 12:55 AM,So many don't have the APs that you do,
joazlazer#2041,22-May-18 12:55 AM,chances are you're better than the average instate,
pnw#8833,22-May-18 12:55 AM,"i think i got into tech because i had incredible engineering experience, not nessiarly incredible academics",
Caw#1913,22-May-18 12:55 AM,"So while you may be behind some OOS just because of your situation, you will still be fine at tech",
saxon_dr#3806,22-May-18 12:55 AM,also if anything i think,
saxon_dr#3806,22-May-18 12:55 AM,college is a clean slate,
Caw#1913,22-May-18 12:56 AM,We should get a flair for OOs and in state,
saxon_dr#3806,22-May-18 12:56 AM,my friend had like everything you could imagine to have,
joazlazer#2041,22-May-18 12:56 AM,yessss,
saxon_dr#3806,22-May-18 12:56 AM,and she still struggled at first in college cuz she's not used to having to really work hard just for grades,
saxon_dr#3806,22-May-18 12:56 AM,all those things just get you to college once it starts the majority of the difference in previous courses/experience can be made up for in like a year or two i think,
pnw#8833,22-May-18 12:57 AM,i honeslty cant wait for college,
saxon_dr#3806,22-May-18 12:57 AM,i mean ofc there are those people that are just relaly op,
pnw#8833,22-May-18 12:57 AM,have the current tech seniors graduate yet?,
saxon_dr#3806,22-May-18 12:57 AM,same i want high school to be over :ResidentSleeper:,

thedragonlegacy#2854,22-May-18 01:21 AM,"o, now that i think about my age, it does seem much of a gap now",
joazlazer#2041,22-May-18 01:21 AM,"and about 10k this year from outside (national merit, mu alpha theta, hispanic scholarship ( 🤞 )",
joazlazer#2041,22-May-18 01:22 AM,yah i mean it's only 2 years,
joazlazer#2041,22-May-18 01:22 AM,it seemed like a huge diff when i was in 3rd grade,
joazlazer#2041,22-May-18 01:22 AM,but now it seems pretty normal,
Caw#1913,22-May-18 01:23 AM,When did you skip your grades?,
joazlazer#2041,22-May-18 01:23 AM,1st -> 3rd in elementary school,
joazlazer#2041,22-May-18 01:23 AM,so ages ago to me,

joazlazer#2041,22-May-18 01:25 AM,but then she skipped another 2 grades in high school,
Snowfish#4289,22-May-18 01:25 AM,sounds miserable,
joazlazer#2041,22-May-18 01:26 AM,tbh,
thedragonlegacy#2854,22-May-18 01:27 AM,do you find it hard to connect with your peers bc you skipped grades?,
joazlazer#2041,22-May-18 01:27 AM,all my friends are socially inept so its okay,

efank#9753,22-May-18 05:44 AM,@saxon_dr#3806 ya interested in meeting up at some point,
saxon_dr#3806,22-May-18 08:57 AM,yeah sure whenever u want,
8726andrew#5709,22-May-18 08:57 AM,There’s a kid who’s graduating my hs at 14,
8726andrew#5709,22-May-18 08:58 AM,We all feel bad for him bc his family has ruined his social life basically,
saxon_dr#3806,22-May-18 08:59 AM,yeah,
saxon_dr#3806,22-May-18 08:59 AM,well if he goes onto grad school then that wouldn’t be so bad,
8726andrew#5709,22-May-18 09:00 AM,There’s nothing good about it,
8726andrew#5709,22-May-18 09:01 AM,He has pretty much no friends,
8726andrew#5709,22-May-18 09:02 AM,All he’s ever really done is school so when he finishes who knows how he’s going to be when he gets away from his insane parents,
8726andrew#5709,22-May-18 09:05 AM,One of my friends tried to get him to do robotics and he went to like one meeting before his parents made him quit,
Rye#0666,22-May-18 10:16 AM,Yeah I guess his parents don't realize that the social aspect of high school is just as important,
Rye#0666,22-May-18 10:16 AM,Or just school in general,
Rye#0666,22-May-18 10:17 AM,You only get one childhood; why spend it all doing schoolwork?,
8726andrew#5709,22-May-18 10:17 AM,There’s a reason people normally don’t skip grades even if they technically could,
Rye#0666,22-May-18 10:17 AM,I know I wouldn't,
saxon_dr#3806,22-May-18 10:23 AM,what i was saying about grad school is that,
saxon_dr#3806,22-May-18 10:24 AM,terence tao (widely regarded as the best mathematician alive) also went to college super early and he did say that this means he couldn't really do parties or w/e and had a really bland social life,
saxon_dr#3806,22-May-18 10:25 AM,but once grad school came things were much better since you don't need to be all same age and he was legal age and everyone there liked the same things he did,
joazlazer#2041,22-May-18 11:59 AM,hopefully i wont be a social reject at tech,
joazlazer#2041,22-May-18 11:59 AM,tho ill should be fine bc i did some clubs in hs,
joazlazer#2041,22-May-18 12:00 PM,tho tbh i just joined clubs junior year and took them over the next year by becoming the presiding officer of each one,
joazlazer#2041,22-May-18 12:00 PM,🤷,

8726andrew#5709,22-May-18 12:04 PM,It’s not a tech affiliated thing it’s like Nshss except for college kids,
joazlazer#2041,22-May-18 12:05 PM,oh is that the scam thing for high schoolers?,
joazlazer#2041,22-May-18 12:05 PM,didnt know they had one for college,
8726andrew#5709,22-May-18 12:06 PM,Yeah they don’t stop,
8726andrew#5709,22-May-18 12:06 PM,There’s a couple of them,
saxon_dr#3806,22-May-18 12:06 PM,loool that thing,
saxon_dr#3806,22-May-18 12:06 PM,they sent it to me saying xxx and xxx from your school did our program in the past,
saxon_dr#3806,22-May-18 12:06 PM,i sure hoped they're just trolling and those kids didn't actually get scammed into it,
joazlazer#2041,22-May-18 12:07 PM,idk pretty sure it works on a lot of kids,
joazlazer#2041,22-May-18 12:07 PM,which is sad but idk if NSHSS does anything good,
saxon_dr#3806,22-May-18 12:07 PM,i mean i guess in my school's case that thing is in DC,
saxon_dr#3806,22-May-18 12:07 PM,and we're like 15 minutes away,
saxon_dr#3806,22-May-18 12:08 PM,so maybe they just thought eh it's not that much of a time investment to go there,
saxon_dr#3806,22-May-18 12:08 PM,:k3llyShrug:,
saxon_dr#3806,22-May-18 12:10 PM,i think the social aspects apply tho,

Snowfish#4289,24-May-18 01:26 PM,"@efank#9753 for what its worth, any CS student who has taken 2110 (which is almost everyone) has used linux VMs :)",
joazlazer#2041,24-May-18 01:56 PM,just looked at the syllabus; looks like an interesting class,
joazlazer#2041,24-May-18 01:59 PM,when do cs majors usually take it @Snowfish#4289 ?,
joazlazer#2041,24-May-18 02:11 PM,broader question: what will be the first CS class one would take if they havve credit from APCSA?,
Snowfish#4289,24-May-18 02:28 PM,typically third semester,
Snowfish#4289,24-May-18 02:29 PM,sine the sequence is 1301 (python) -> 1331 (java) -> 2110 (assembly/C) and 1332 (algorithms),
Snowfish#4289,24-May-18 02:30 PM,oh,
Snowfish#4289,24-May-18 02:30 PM,APCSA gives you 1301 credit,
Snowfish#4289,24-May-18 02:30 PM,"a flowchart can be found for each thread (but ill link you one for one of mine, since it's pretty standard)",
Snowfish#4289,24-May-18 02:31 PM,https://www.cc.gatech.edu/sites/default/files/images/prereqinfointernetworks2016-17.pdf,
Snowfish#4289,24-May-18 02:31 PM,"the ones with *'s are basically exclusive to the thread, but the rest are general (with a few exceptions not being in other threads, like 2200 isnt required for all of them)",
joazlazer#2041,24-May-18 03:39 PM,csa gives python credit so you start in an intro java class,
joazlazer#2041,24-May-18 03:39 PM,:Thonk_transparent:,
joazlazer#2041,24-May-18 03:40 PM,tbh thats a hard thonk,

joazlazer#2041,24-May-18 03:52 PM,don't a lot of freshmen come in with CSA credit? If so why would they give credit for python not java?,
saxon_dr#3806,24-May-18 03:52 PM,i think someone talked about this in the past,
MEE6#4876,24-May-18 03:52 PM,"GG @saxon_dr#3806, you just advanced to level 13!",

joazlazer#2041,24-May-18 03:53 PM,idk,
joazlazer#2041,24-May-18 03:53 PM,follow up: is it worth learning python over the summer since i might never take a class on it?,
saxon_dr#3806,24-May-18 03:54 PM,i mean sure,
saxon_dr#3806,24-May-18 03:54 PM,i personally really like python,
saxon_dr#3806,24-May-18 03:54 PM,it's really clean and simple to use,
saxon_dr#3806,24-May-18 03:54 PM,and it's great for data science,
joazlazer#2041,24-May-18 03:54 PM,i dont :3,
joazlazer#2041,24-May-18 03:54 PM,but i guess ill learn,
saxon_dr#3806,24-May-18 03:54 PM,why not :/,
joazlazer#2041,24-May-18 03:54 PM,it just seems so basic and icky,
joazlazer#2041,24-May-18 03:54 PM,id rather use  a proper oop like java or c#,
saxon_dr#3806,24-May-18 03:55 PM,well if it's really that basic it wouldn't be the language that Google uses,
saxon_dr#3806,24-May-18 03:55 PM,:albieShrug:,
joazlazer#2041,24-May-18 03:55 PM,🤷,
Snowfish#4289,24-May-18 04:12 PM,no you don’t need to learn python,
Snowfish#4289,24-May-18 04:13 PM,they only use python since it is a very very intuitive language which makes it really good to use to teach new programmers,
Snowfish#4289,24-May-18 04:13 PM,"in reality, you don’t ever really use it again unless you want to",
Gadget246#0848,24-May-18 04:14 PM,"pros of python:, clean, easy to learn, easy to read, easy to debug, demonstrates fundamentals of procedural programming, teaches good indentation (by requiring it), lots of downloadable libraries, cons:, if you learn python as your first language i s2g you will never be able to write anything without forgetting whatever ""ending a logic statement"" syntax that language uses every other instance for the rest of your life, no compiler (I have since been told that this is a dumb con to list but I was thinking of python as a learning tool and compilers are a thing to learn about so idk)",
joazlazer#2041,24-May-18 04:17 PM,i mean python is an interpeted language right?,
joazlazer#2041,24-May-18 04:17 PM,so it makes sense not to have a compiler,
joazlazer#2041,24-May-18 04:17 PM,so it comes with the strengths of interpreted languages,
joazlazer#2041,24-May-18 04:18 PM,i.e. python scripts are a good candidate for behavior scripts for games intended to be distributed by a CDN,
joazlazer#2041,24-May-18 04:18 PM,because they can be dynamically loaded,
joazlazer#2041,24-May-18 04:18 PM,but idk it just seems like an icky language to do anything other than scripts in,
saxon_dr#3806,24-May-18 04:19 PM,yeah why would there be a python compiler,
saxon_dr#3806,24-May-18 04:20 PM,well vanilla python isnt' that good but,
saxon_dr#3806,24-May-18 04:21 PM,it has some really really good libraries,
saxon_dr#3806,24-May-18 04:21 PM,and the cross platform support is pretty good too,
Gadget246#0848,24-May-18 04:21 PM,"i'm not super experienced as a programmer so i might be out of my depth here, but I think if you're wanting a program that does stuff outside of the program then python might not be the thing to use, but if you're wanting something self contained it's pretty dang great",
Snowfish#4289,24-May-18 04:28 PM,"python is really good for simple scripts, and people usually use it for simulations or really small automations",
Snowfish#4289,24-May-18 04:28 PM,"the downside is, since it's so simple, it's really hard to make larger, complex programs",

joazlazer#2041,24-May-18 09:23 PM,1) GIT :PepeHands:,
joazlazer#2041,24-May-18 09:24 PM,2) 87k / degree is a huge :OMEGALUL: for OOS students,
joazlazer#2041,24-May-18 09:28 PM,but i guess with the aid im planning on getting (lookin at the 42k cybercorps program) 90k is probably accurate,

Snowfish#4289,27-May-18 07:07 PM,what exactly goes on in really big groupmes?,
Snowfish#4289,27-May-18 07:07 PM,i never joined any cuz i just assumed theyd be shitposts,
joazlazer#2041,27-May-18 07:08 PM,the CS groupme is just a bunch of discussions about what laptops to buy,
joazlazer#2041,27-May-18 07:08 PM,plus essay writer spambots of course,
Snowfish#4289,27-May-18 07:09 PM,"ah yes, the ""i'm gonna buy a $2000 laptop and run ubuntu"" chats",
joazlazer#2041,27-May-18 07:10 PM,some people want to buy $150 dollar chromebooks and rely on CRD for classes to remote into their desktops (which would presumably reside in their dorms),
Chafos#1781,27-May-18 07:12 PM,I’m going to invest in a $1500 computer just because I am finally allowed to make such an investment and I really want one that actually runs smoothly for different stuff,
Chafos#1781,27-May-18 07:13 PM,so imma probably use it to game to make use of the high end parts I’ll get with that money,
Chafos#1781,27-May-18 07:13 PM,still not sure if I should buy a new laptop or buy a new desktop and bring my halfway decent current laptop,
saxon_dr#3806,27-May-18 07:17 PM,i'd say desktop :albieShrug:,
Snowfish#4289,27-May-18 07:19 PM,ngl after being in college i wish i had invested in a nice gaming laptop,
joazlazer#2041,27-May-18 07:21 PM,but wouldn't that be so heavy to have to carry around?,
Snowfish#4289,27-May-18 07:21 PM,"i feel like the tradeoff of being able to play easily in the dorm, take it to chill with other people, take it home easily, etc would've been wroth it",
joazlazer#2041,27-May-18 07:23 PM,yeah that doesn't sound bad (also I'm about to level up with this message :evilpatrick: :SquidDab: ),
MEE6#4876,27-May-18 07:23 PM,"GG @joazlazer#2041, you just advanced to level 13!",

8726andrew#5709,27-May-18 08:34 PM,For every college,
Snowfish#4289,27-May-18 08:34 PM,ah ok,
Snowfish#4289,27-May-18 08:34 PM,pretty much what i expected,
saxon_dr#3806,27-May-18 08:34 PM,btw what are some things that i need to figure out before faset?,
Snowfish#4289,27-May-18 08:34 PM,my roommate was big into those mega group chats and she’d show them to me and it was literally just shitty memes,
Snowfish#4289,27-May-18 08:35 PM,"a general idea of your schedule, although your advisor will help you with that",
saxon_dr#3806,27-May-18 08:35 PM,are these advisors actually useful,
saxon_dr#3806,27-May-18 08:35 PM,btw,
Snowfish#4289,27-May-18 08:35 PM,idk lol,
Snowfish#4289,27-May-18 08:35 PM,i wasn’t a CS major at FASET,
saxon_dr#3806,27-May-18 08:35 PM,oh,
Snowfish#4289,27-May-18 08:35 PM,i’ve always had a bad experience with my advisor,
Snowfish#4289,27-May-18 08:36 PM,he might just be a bad egg or just not like me for some reason,
saxon_dr#3806,27-May-18 08:36 PM,hmm ok,
Snowfish#4289,27-May-18 08:36 PM,but i think they’re still required to give you a schedule,
Snowfish#4289,27-May-18 08:36 PM,or at least attempt to help,
saxon_dr#3806,27-May-18 08:36 PM,oh ok,
Snowfish#4289,27-May-18 08:36 PM,it is their job after all.,
saxon_dr#3806,27-May-18 08:38 PM,i'm just gonna start thinking about that in the summer i guess :albieShrug:,
saxon_dr#3806,27-May-18 08:38 PM,still waiting to graduate :ResidentSleeper:,
Snowfish#4289,27-May-18 08:38 PM,a schedule? or an advisor,
saxon_dr#3806,27-May-18 08:38 PM,schedule,
Snowfish#4289,27-May-18 08:39 PM,i wouldn’t wait until faset to make a schedule since you have like,
Snowfish#4289,27-May-18 08:39 PM,meet with advisor -> eat food -> more indoctrination -> registration,
Snowfish#4289,27-May-18 08:39 PM,not much time to actually look at classes,
saxon_dr#3806,27-May-18 08:39 PM,no i mean i'm session 7,
saxon_dr#3806,27-May-18 08:39 PM,so i could just think about that during june or july rite,
Snowfish#4289,27-May-18 08:40 PM,oh rofl yea,
saxon_dr#3806,27-May-18 08:41 PM,can't wait for this derpy summer doing absolutely nothing of substance :albieHYPERS:,

Le Noir DragooN#8434,28-May-18 10:40 AM,did anybody sign up for any extended orientation programs?,
angrymunch739#7866,28-May-18 10:43 AM,@BradfordOfMars#9837 @Snowfish#4289 When is it a good time to take the subsidized loans?,
BradfordOfMars#9837,28-May-18 12:02 PM,You should probably always take subsidized loans since you don’t accumulate any interest while you’re still in school.,
angrymunch739#7866,28-May-18 12:25 PM,"Yeah, when would you recommend taking out the loan? I am confused on when to take out the loan",
BradfordOfMars#9837,28-May-18 12:26 PM,Shouldn't really matter,
BradfordOfMars#9837,28-May-18 12:26 PM,There's no harm in doing it as early as possible,
BradfordOfMars#9837,28-May-18 12:28 PM,It should all be dispersed at the same time shortly before school starts anyways,
angrymunch739#7866,28-May-18 12:28 PM,Thanks,
Thedarkbobman#8576,28-May-18 01:11 PM,anyone know when the waitlist comes out,
Thedarkbobman#8576,28-May-18 01:12 PM,I have a friend who is on it,
Thedarkbobman#8576,28-May-18 01:12 PM,he is pretty anxious considering its the 28th,
Rye#0666,28-May-18 01:39 PM,Shouldn't it already be out?,
Rye#0666,28-May-18 01:40 PM,Considering deposits were due May 1,
MooshRum#3936,28-May-18 01:41 PM,Most likely. I don't know anyone who got waitlisted and then got in,
Le Noir DragooN#8434,28-May-18 03:53 PM,how do you know what your georgia tech email address is?,
8726andrew#5709,28-May-18 04:14 PM,its the id they give you @gatech.edu,
8726andrew#5709,28-May-18 04:14 PM,like the example they always give is gburdell3@gatech.edu,
brumeux#4293,28-May-18 04:25 PM,the only waitlisted person who got in that i know of got a call on may 1st,
Rye#0666,28-May-18 04:55 PM,@Thedarkbobman#8576 Hopefully your friend put down a deposit for some school,
Rye#0666,28-May-18 04:55 PM,Wasn't May 1 the day for most schools?,
saxon_dr#3806,28-May-18 05:00 PM,nah most schools do waitlist pretty late,
saxon_dr#3806,28-May-18 05:01 PM,the ones that were open to me are all out in june or something,
saxon_dr#3806,28-May-18 05:01 PM,that's the whole point of waitlist,
saxon_dr#3806,28-May-18 05:01 PM,you have to put down deposit to another school first,
saxon_dr#3806,28-May-18 05:01 PM,and then if you get into your waitlist you have to cancel your admission,
Snowfish#4289,28-May-18 06:49 PM,made a small server change to hopefully prevent bots from spamming,
Snowfish#4289,28-May-18 06:49 PM,and hopefully you guys can still talk :monkaMEGA:,
8726andrew#5709,28-May-18 06:49 PM,Maybe?,
8726andrew#5709,28-May-18 06:50 PM,Test,
Caw#1913,28-May-18 06:52 PM,Did you change the default welcome message so it tells people they have to put a rank?,
Thedarkbobman#8576,28-May-18 07:35 PM,"@Rye#0666 yeah he has a deposit down for another school, but I know he really wanted to get off the waitlist so i wanted to see if it was still possible",
Thedarkbobman#8576,28-May-18 07:36 PM,can anyone send me the discord invite link,
Thedarkbobman#8576,28-May-18 07:36 PM,"my friend got in, but the facebook invite link expired",
Snowfish#4289,28-May-18 07:44 PM,@Caw#1913 it kinda already does but ill make it more explicit i guess,
Samsung#6949,28-May-18 08:39 PM,How would you recommend building our schedules? Taking what looks interesting? Are there required courses we should be looking at as freshman for different majors and where can we find that info?,
joazlazer#2041,28-May-18 08:59 PM,ok this might be a dumb question,
joazlazer#2041,28-May-18 08:59 PM,"but, like, what is the deal with the competitive downproofing tag?",
joazlazer#2041,28-May-18 08:59 PM,like I read about it on the wiki,
joazlazer#2041,28-May-18 09:00 PM,is it just a synonym for current students?,
Lennox#3038,28-May-18 09:00 PM,iirc it started as a way to give people a rank who didnt declare a major,
Lennox#3038,28-May-18 09:00 PM,first it was underwater basketweaving,
Lennox#3038,28-May-18 09:01 PM,then they wanted to make it more fitting to tech,
Lennox#3038,28-May-18 09:02 PM,(for this discord server specifically),
KyotoKoto#5113,28-May-18 09:02 PM,@Samsung#6949 https://www.physics.gatech.edu/academics/undergraduate/course-schedule this is a tentative schedule to follow if you're a physics major (or at least that's what it looks like after googling for 2 seconds),
joazlazer#2041,28-May-18 09:02 PM,ok I see,
Snowfish#4289,28-May-18 09:11 PM,@Samsung#6949 i'd mostly focus on the courses that are prerequisites for the most courses,
kk4jrq#5652,28-May-18 09:21 PM,"@joazlazer#2041 it's supposed to say competitive drownproofing but it's misspelled.  At GT, all students were 'drownproffed' up until the late 60's.  My grandfather went through it when he was there",
joazlazer#2041,28-May-18 09:21 PM,yeye i read the tech traditions wiki,
kk4jrq#5652,28-May-18 09:21 PM,Nice,
kk4jrq#5652,28-May-18 09:21 PM,I think they should reinstate it tbh. It is pretty cool.,

Samsung#6949,28-May-18 10:07 PM,ye Im taking a look,
Samsung#6949,28-May-18 10:08 PM,when/how do you choose if you want credit for aps?,
Snowfish#4289,28-May-18 10:09 PM,it's automatically given to you iirc,
Samsung#6949,28-May-18 10:37 PM,oh ok,
Samsung#6949,28-May-18 10:37 PM,I'm just like still not sure if I wanna switch my major to me,
Samsung#6949,28-May-18 10:37 PM,but I think most of the freshman courses are the same anyways,

8726andrew#5709,29-May-18 03:44 PM,i dont think we're required to,
8726andrew#5709,29-May-18 03:44 PM,freshman year its only if you're in FE,
udishab#2211,29-May-18 03:45 PM,freshman year they make you get the most expensive one but i hear most people get cheaper meal plans sophomore year so i assume not required,
angrymunch739#7866,29-May-18 04:05 PM,"Is it true that the last Fasets get stuck with the bad professors, time slots, and classes get filled?",
angrymunch739#7866,29-May-18 04:05 PM,👏,
joazlazer#2041,29-May-18 04:07 PM,Every mention I've seen of FASET says that they unlock a new batch of seats for each class at every session,
joazlazer#2041,29-May-18 04:07 PM,so presumably no,
angrymunch739#7866,29-May-18 04:09 PM,Hopefully thats true,
angrymunch739#7866,29-May-18 04:17 PM,Dam,
angrymunch739#7866,29-May-18 04:17 PM,Is there a way to change the faset date,
angrymunch739#7866,29-May-18 04:18 PM,I want to move up,
joazlazer#2041,29-May-18 04:18 PM,you can ~~fill out a form~~ send an email? iirc,
joazlazer#2041,29-May-18 04:18 PM,but it's not a guarantee to have the date changed,
8726andrew#5709,29-May-18 04:18 PM,you have to send an email,
angrymunch739#7866,29-May-18 04:18 PM,When will they give me a decision through the form,
angrymunch739#7866,29-May-18 04:18 PM,Email who tho?,
8726andrew#5709,29-May-18 04:19 PM,if you go find the email you got when you applied for faset they tell you,

Caw#1913,29-May-18 09:56 PM,"@bopas2#1774 as far as I know, there aren't many opportunities formally if you're fresh into your major/just starting. However, that doesn't stop you from talking to a professor on your own and seeing if they need some help around a lab or just talking to them about their research",
Caw#1913,29-May-18 09:56 PM,It's definitely worth it if you're going to grad school,
bopas2#1774,29-May-18 10:28 PM,"I want to do ECE/CS stuff...I don't know if I want to go to grad school, which is why I want to get some research experience -- to see if I like it and to get some applied learning on my resume. However, Conner is right in saying that my knowledge is super limited, so I don't know if, even if I was able to get a position, it would be worthwhile compared to joining a technical club or something similar where I could be more involved in the work. opinions?",
MEE6#4876,29-May-18 11:34 PM,"GG @Inko#4822, you just advanced to level 1!",
Nobo#2748,30-May-18 02:14 PM,Research is easy to get as long as you get to know a professor that is overseeing ongoing projects,

8726andrew#5709,30-May-18 05:22 PM,"That’s too many friends, how about like half price for 70.5 friends instead",
udishab#2211,30-May-18 05:23 PM,yikes do you cut one of the friends in half,
Snowfish#4289,30-May-18 05:23 PM,well what if you dont like the 70.5 that you get,
8726andrew#5709,30-May-18 05:23 PM,I mean that’s the risk you’re taking,
8726andrew#5709,30-May-18 05:24 PM,The other half could be exactly the same,
udishab#2211,30-May-18 05:24 PM,im poor can i just have 35.25 friends,
Snowfish#4289,30-May-18 05:24 PM,can i pay double for 282 friends?,
8726andrew#5709,30-May-18 05:24 PM,I mean you can cut one in half or you could just share them with someone else,
8726andrew#5709,30-May-18 05:24 PM,Or they’re only like half a friend and half not,
8726andrew#5709,30-May-18 05:25 PM,I’m not sure how you get a quarter friend though that’s tricky,
Snowfish#4289,30-May-18 05:25 PM,that's the guy that will invite you to hang out but always flake at the last minute,
8726andrew#5709,30-May-18 05:25 PM,Oh I hate that guy,

8726andrew#5709,04-Jun-18 08:32 PM,so like august 20 something,
BradfordOfMars#9837,04-Jun-18 08:33 PM,Yeah it just gets charged to your student account when you register for a date,
KyotoKoto#5113,04-Jun-18 08:37 PM,"gotcha, ,  I know it's a while away but how useful is it for first years to go to the career fair, since most of us probably don't much professional experience in our respective industries",
Nobo#2748,04-Jun-18 09:09 PM,it's perfectly fine either or,
Nobo#2748,04-Jun-18 09:10 PM,"But if you want to, you can go and get a sense of how it feels",

Gadget246#0848,10-Jun-18 06:14 PM,how do I check to make sure tech received my transcript?,
KyotoKoto#5113,10-Jun-18 06:17 PM,you could call their registrar office,
kk4jrq#5652,10-Jun-18 06:18 PM,Or check on the admissions status page,
kk4jrq#5652,10-Jun-18 06:19 PM,That's the easiet way,
brumeux#4293,10-Jun-18 06:34 PM,@Gadget246#0848 i think you shouldve gotten an email from parchment about it,
Gadget246#0848,10-Jun-18 07:33 PM,I got an email from parchment but i wanted to check that GT agreed they had gotten it,
Gadget246#0848,10-Jun-18 07:33 PM,@kk4jrq#5652 I looked for it in my admissions account and wasn't able to find it. Where did you find it?,

Lormen#5686,10-Jun-18 08:54 PM,"what does the financial need mean in the context of my award letter? this isn't really for me, but it would help my dad so I can explain it to him in the clearest terms?",
Lormen#5686,10-Jun-18 08:56 PM,"like, if my need was X amount of dollars, what does the X amount of dollars entail? (housing, books, tuition, that kinda thing)",
Nobo#2748,10-Jun-18 09:00 PM,"Financial Need is the calculated amount that you potentially could (in vague terms) need, after expected calculations on cost of living on campus, etc, whatever",
Nobo#2748,10-Jun-18 09:00 PM,so yeah,
Nobo#2748,10-Jun-18 09:01 PM,"It's the estimated amount you need to be at Tech, usually a bit on the upper end but relatively usable",
Nobo#2748,10-Jun-18 09:01 PM,"it's what allows the Fed to figure out priority for federal direct loans, GT deciding grants, etc",
Lormen#5686,10-Jun-18 09:10 PM,"so if my need was, let's hypothetically say, $5000 for the whole year on my letter. And let's say that Zell Miller covers $5,003 a semester. Does that mean that I would be in a good spot?",
MEE6#4876,10-Jun-18 09:10 PM,"GG @Lormen#5686, you just advanced to level 1!",
Lormen#5686,10-Jun-18 09:54 PM,"Like, would that cover the payments I would need to attend GT?",
kk4jrq#5652,10-Jun-18 10:52 PM,I think that letter accounts for zell so you probably need those additional $5000,
kk4jrq#5652,10-Jun-18 10:52 PM,I'm not 100% sure though,
Lormen#5686,10-Jun-18 10:53 PM,"well I would get about 10,008",
kk4jrq#5652,10-Jun-18 10:53 PM,"But you don't get money, it just pays for the tuition side of things",
kk4jrq#5652,10-Jun-18 10:54 PM,"You can't put it towards like books, fees, etc. and they probably already took the fact you have zell into account when deciding your need",
Lormen#5686,10-Jun-18 10:58 PM,ah,
kk4jrq#5652,10-Jun-18 11:20 PM,Yeah hope that helps... but I'm no expert so be sure to confirm so you know you're in good shape.,
KyotoKoto#5113,10-Jun-18 11:20 PM,"after filling out FAFSA back in October, the form said my ""Expected Family Contribution (EFC) = * * * * *"" (it gave an actual number), , is there any way to estimate how much FAFSA funding you'll get based on the ""expected Family Contribution"" number they calculated?",
Lormen#5686,10-Jun-18 11:22 PM,that I will do. Thanks!,
Lormen#5686,10-Jun-18 11:22 PM,I believe that is what the need is,
Snowfish#4289,11-Jun-18 01:57 AM,"if the EFC number is lower than the expected cost of enrollment, you'll usually get some $$",
thedragonlegacy#2854,11-Jun-18 05:31 AM,:PepeHands:  *some*,
joazlazer#2041,11-Jun-18 09:21 AM,:PepeHands:,
kk4jrq#5652,11-Jun-18 09:25 AM,Or if your EFC is equal to the expected cost of enrollment you get nothing  :PepeHands:,
ValkyrieViper#5174,11-Jun-18 10:21 AM,does it matter what FASET session you are? Because it seems like the later FASET sessions get screwed because all the best class times will be filled up by then,
ValkyrieViper#5174,11-Jun-18 10:22 AM,because all the people from the earlier FASET sessions will register first,
kk4jrq#5652,11-Jun-18 10:22 AM,They keep slots reserved for each session so you'll be fine.,
ValkyrieViper#5174,11-Jun-18 11:28 AM,"Alright thanks, I am in a later FASET session so i thought i was fucked for classes haha",
kk4jrq#5652,11-Jun-18 12:12 PM,You all good man.  No need to fear,
joazlazer#2041,11-Jun-18 12:13 PM,is the Committed groupchat really toxic rn or is it just me?,
joazlazer#2041,11-Jun-18 12:13 PM,😬,
KyotoKoto#5113,11-Jun-18 12:14 PM,i already finished my core classes and now i'm set to take major-specific classes.. will seats in those classes still reserved for FASET? :thonk:,
brumeux#4293,11-Jun-18 12:15 PM,i don't think they reserve upper level classes that freshmen wouldn't normally be able to take,
KyotoKoto#5113,11-Jun-18 12:21 PM,"o h, yikes",
kk4jrq#5652,11-Jun-18 12:25 PM,Yeah they don't... But they also probably have a few spots left and only freshman are left to register.,
KyotoKoto#5113,11-Jun-18 12:27 PM,"i made my tentative schedule on courseoff, and most of the classes i want are full atm, so after i'm able to register, i'll just watch the seats like a hawk (and/or wait till Phase 2)",
efank#9753,11-Jun-18 12:45 PM,@joazlazer#2041  sry just curious,
efank#9753,11-Jun-18 12:45 PM,hows' it being toxic,

efank#9753,11-Jun-18 12:46 PM,y dun they want him there,
8726andrew#5709,11-Jun-18 12:46 PM,Not me I promise,
joazlazer#2041,11-Jun-18 12:46 PM,"he's being 'too negative', and he had some controvertial hip hop opinions",
efank#9753,11-Jun-18 12:46 PM,de fuck?,
efank#9753,11-Jun-18 12:47 PM,im' confused,
joazlazer#2041,11-Jun-18 12:47 PM,tbh I would like to know the negatives of atlanta,
efank#9753,11-Jun-18 12:47 PM,isn't pierce the toxic one here,
joazlazer#2041,11-Jun-18 12:47 PM,I dont want to know all the positives,
joazlazer#2041,11-Jun-18 12:47 PM,yeah,
8726andrew#5709,11-Jun-18 12:47 PM,This just sounds like pointless drama for no reason,
joazlazer#2041,11-Jun-18 12:47 PM,and theyre getting a bunch of likes,
efank#9753,11-Jun-18 12:47 PM,can i go on the groupme,

8726andrew#5709,11-Jun-18 12:47 PM,Still think these committed chats are pointless bc everyone is committed now js,
efank#9753,11-Jun-18 12:48 PM,how do i get there,
joazlazer#2041,11-Jun-18 12:48 PM,its dumb that theyre mad because I want to know the negatives of tech,
joazlazer#2041,11-Jun-18 12:48 PM,ill hear all about the positives at FASET,
efank#9753,11-Jun-18 12:48 PM,y do they want a c i r c l e j e r k,
joazlazer#2041,11-Jun-18 12:48 PM,but I want to hear from an upperclassman,
joazlazer#2041,11-Jun-18 12:48 PM,lmao,
efank#9753,11-Jun-18 12:48 PM,had t ospace it out,
joazlazer#2041,11-Jun-18 12:48 PM,filtered,
efank#9753,11-Jun-18 12:48 PM,to get past the f u c king filter,
8726andrew#5709,11-Jun-18 12:48 PM,I mean downtown atl is pretty sketch bc big city but that’s kinda generic,
joazlazer#2041,11-Jun-18 12:49 PM,LMAOOOO,
8726andrew#5709,11-Jun-18 12:49 PM,Oof,
joazlazer#2041,11-Jun-18 12:49 PM,nice filter :haHAA:,
8726andrew#5709,11-Jun-18 12:49 PM,Why do we need a filter,
8726andrew#5709,11-Jun-18 12:49 PM,Like is it really that deep,
joazlazer#2041,11-Jun-18 12:49 PM,we're all children who can't handle mean words,
efank#9753,11-Jun-18 12:49 PM,i don't get why people arent' calling pierce,
efank#9753,11-Jun-18 12:50 PM,out on his bullshit,
joazlazer#2041,11-Jun-18 12:50 PM,11 btw :haHAA:,
8726andrew#5709,11-Jun-18 12:50 PM,I’m 12,
8726andrew#5709,11-Jun-18 12:50 PM,Mommy said no curse words allowed,
8726andrew#5709,11-Jun-18 12:50 PM,I mean most people probably just don’t actually care,
8726andrew#5709,11-Jun-18 12:51 PM,Like normally I’d call people out but something like this it’s like not worth the effort of dealing with it,
efank#9753,11-Jun-18 12:51 PM,fair enough,
KyotoKoto#5113,11-Jun-18 12:52 PM,"@efank#9753 it's because ""Andrew"" is being rude and bitchy and making people in the group pissed/uncomfortable, thus, by Pierce telling Andrew to kindly shut up, he's said the thing that the people are thinking but don't have the will to say",
joazlazer#2041,11-Jun-18 12:52 PM,idk people need to chill,
efank#9753,11-Jun-18 12:53 PM,"@KyotoKoto#5113  ah, fine though to be fair, the only context i had was the screenshot but i don't think you can say that pierce was being kind about it all though",
efank#9753,11-Jun-18 12:53 PM,"like from the context alone, pierce sounds like the asshloe, not andrew?",
efank#9753,11-Jun-18 12:53 PM,i'm not sure,
efank#9753,11-Jun-18 12:53 PM,@KyotoKoto#5113  check the screenshot sent into the chat,
efank#9753,11-Jun-18 12:53 PM,ther ewas one sent in here,
efank#9753,11-Jun-18 12:53 PM,that i based my opinion off of,
efank#9753,11-Jun-18 12:54 PM,but that's all i got to see,
efank#9753,11-Jun-18 12:54 PM,saying you'd have chosen not to go to tech are some pretty harsh words,
KyotoKoto#5113,11-Jun-18 12:56 PM,"i understand why there was a miscommunication, sorry for not being more explicit! i thought it would be clear that Andrew was so toxic to the point that Pierce would have considered not going to tech if Andrew was a mod, etc + Andrew even said he was toxic",
joazlazer#2041,11-Jun-18 12:57 PM,idk I didn't read all of it,
8726andrew#5709,11-Jun-18 12:57 PM,Sounds like quite the mess,
8726andrew#5709,11-Jun-18 12:57 PM,Probably not worth reading lol,
efank#9753,11-Jun-18 12:57 PM,fair enough @KyotoKoto#5113  that still sukcs in general to have gone on in the chat still kinda sad to see,
efank#9753,11-Jun-18 12:58 PM,nevermind i understand that a bit more now,
joazlazer#2041,11-Jun-18 12:58 PM,but after being in #overwatch in the esports server I'm used to toxic :monkaS:,
efank#9753,11-Jun-18 12:58 PM,@joazlazer#2041  lmao,
efank#9753,11-Jun-18 12:58 PM,"@KyotoKoto#5113  i mean also, the fact that if you take that out of context, pierce being this heated too, just not pretty in general",
efank#9753,11-Jun-18 12:58 PM,ah oh well,
MKA#5877,11-Jun-18 12:58 PM,andrew is just a big meme in the committed groupme,
efank#9753,11-Jun-18 12:58 PM,ur right tho andrew,
efank#9753,11-Jun-18 12:58 PM,better to just not make a fuss,
efank#9753,11-Jun-18 12:59 PM,i meant 8762andrew lmao,

efank#9753,11-Jun-18 01:09 PM,i guess i started w/ ubnutu,
efank#9753,11-Jun-18 01:09 PM,can't go wrong,
efank#9753,11-Jun-18 01:09 PM,i started w/ a month of ubuntu,
efank#9753,11-Jun-18 01:10 PM,then moved onto Arch Linux for half a year,
efank#9753,11-Jun-18 01:10 PM,then Gentoo,
efank#9753,11-Jun-18 01:10 PM,oh wait,

efank#9753,11-Jun-18 01:10 PM,it's more of just learning your way around linux,
joazlazer#2041,11-Jun-18 01:11 PM,I don't know what I would use Linux for rn 🤷,
efank#9753,11-Jun-18 01:11 PM,"@joazlazer#2041 wait, y'd you go dang when i mentioned BSD tho",
bopas2#1774,11-Jun-18 01:11 PM,yeah rn I just don’t know why I would use it over windows,
efank#9753,11-Jun-18 01:11 PM,i use it as my primary OS,
joazlazer#2041,11-Jun-18 01:11 PM,I thought maybe I had used Linux,
efank#9753,11-Jun-18 01:11 PM,it is close enough,
efank#9753,11-Jun-18 01:11 PM,BSD is closer to UNIX than linux ish,

saxon_dr#3806,11-Jun-18 07:28 PM,ok so from briefly skimming over the chat it seems like the groupme is being toxic :thonk:,
saxon_dr#3806,11-Jun-18 07:29 PM,when i joined it in april no one was talking and now they're flaming each other,
saxon_dr#3806,11-Jun-18 07:29 PM,interesting,
joazlazer#2041,11-Jun-18 07:33 PM,actually toxic,
joazlazer#2041,11-Jun-18 07:35 PM,tbh Andrew could have been a bit more positive,
joazlazer#2041,11-Jun-18 07:35 PM,but like wtf Pierce is (assumedly) part of the current student leadership or whatever,
joazlazer#2041,11-Jun-18 07:35 PM,the correct thing to do in that situation imo is to pm him,
saxon_dr#3806,11-Jun-18 07:36 PM,yeah,
joazlazer#2041,11-Jun-18 07:36 PM,instead of calling a lynch mob in front of the entire gc,
joazlazer#2041,11-Jun-18 07:38 PM,idk :moon2SHRUG:,
waffle.dynasty#2740,11-Jun-18 07:38 PM,Pierce is part of ROTC,
joazlazer#2041,11-Jun-18 07:38 PM,i remember in high school jrotc is a big :OMEGALUL:,
joazlazer#2041,11-Jun-18 07:39 PM,but i know real rotc is much better,
joazlazer#2041,11-Jun-18 07:39 PM,but i guess that means i shouldn't trash talk his decisions,
joazlazer#2041,11-Jun-18 07:40 PM,:monkaS:,
waffle.dynasty#2740,11-Jun-18 07:40 PM,Honestly Andrew is really helpful with answering questions but he can be too extra sometimes,
joazlazer#2041,11-Jun-18 07:40 PM,"definitely, but I'm glad he's there",
joazlazer#2041,11-Jun-18 07:41 PM,and I'm kinda mad off at the people being rude to him,
joazlazer#2041,11-Jun-18 07:43 PM,like wtf he doesn't have to help u guys,
brumeux#4293,11-Jun-18 07:43 PM,nice to see that drama isnt restricted to the girls groupme lmao,
brumeux#4293,11-Jun-18 07:43 PM,"but that was like, general cattiness about having the same prom dresses i think idk i left",
joazlazer#2041,11-Jun-18 07:44 PM,:OMEGALUL:,
bopas2#1774,11-Jun-18 07:44 PM,"he can be helpful when answering academic questions, but other times he seems super elitist, troll-like and thirsty",
bopas2#1774,11-Jun-18 07:44 PM,i dunno,
joazlazer#2041,11-Jun-18 07:44 PM,can't be as bad as the e-sports server lmao,
waffle.dynasty#2740,11-Jun-18 07:44 PM,Well he's from a wealthy family from LA,
bopas2#1774,11-Jun-18 07:44 PM,^,
brumeux#4293,11-Jun-18 07:45 PM,OH lol and the lgbt groupme descended into madness  too theyre all a major L,
bopas2#1774,11-Jun-18 07:45 PM,"literally LA must be like olympus compared to georgia, according to him",
joazlazer#2041,11-Jun-18 07:45 PM,wealthy californians :moon2PLSNO:,

waffle.dynasty#2740,11-Jun-18 07:46 PM,"I think Andrew is just trying to be funny in his own way when he disses Atlanta, but his jokes just aren't hitting",
joazlazer#2041,11-Jun-18 07:47 PM,that's fair,
brumeux#4293,11-Jun-18 07:47 PM,"a few things! first some straight ppl tried to hijack it and turn it into a gay straight alliance and the person who created it wasnt having that so there was like, a split and move to sc",
brumeux#4293,11-Jun-18 07:49 PM,but of course the groupme still existed and idk someone that people had beef with joined and. idk at one point he asked if bisexual people were real and uhhh idk i left that too,
brumeux#4293,11-Jun-18 07:49 PM,publicly open groupchats tend to implode apparently,
joazlazer#2041,11-Jun-18 07:51 PM,and of course get writing bot thots 😤,
Cole#0059,11-Jun-18 07:52 PM,what happens if i turn in my immunization forms late?,

joazlazer#2041,11-Jun-18 07:53 PM,nothing lol @Cole#0059,
joazlazer#2041,11-Jun-18 07:53 PM,apparently just make sure they're turned in by Faset,

8726andrew#5709,11-Jun-18 07:59 PM,tbf tho they're mostly groupme bots and not discord,

thedragonlegacy#2854,11-Jun-18 08:00 PM,okay i disabled the auto-deleting,
thedragonlegacy#2854,11-Jun-18 08:00 PM,TESTING THIS STUFF,
thedragonlegacy#2854,11-Jun-18 08:01 PM,I BELIEVE IT SHOULD BE WORKING NOW,
joazlazer#2041,11-Jun-18 08:01 PM,the committed groupme is a circlejerk,
joazlazer#2041,11-Jun-18 08:01 PM,it works :Pog:,
thedragonlegacy#2854,11-Jun-18 08:01 PM,oh? havent been on lately,

joazlazer#2041,11-Jun-18 08:02 PM,just stupid words,
8726andrew#5709,11-Jun-18 08:02 PM,it just took a sec,
joazlazer#2041,11-Jun-18 08:02 PM,no i deleted them lmao,

8726andrew#5709,11-Jun-18 08:02 PM,analyst was getting removed before lol,
joazlazer#2041,11-Jun-18 08:03 PM,yeah words like that,
saxon_dr#3806,11-Jun-18 08:09 PM,i think the discord is more peaceful and probably won't descend into madness,
8726andrew#5709,11-Jun-18 08:09 PM,yeah i was just making a joke lol,
saxon_dr#3806,11-Jun-18 08:09 PM,yeah ik,
8726andrew#5709,11-Jun-18 08:09 PM,theres less people overall and most people dont talk anyway,
saxon_dr#3806,11-Jun-18 08:10 PM,yeah and this platform is more self-selecting,
saxon_dr#3806,11-Jun-18 08:10 PM,unlike groupme which is for everyone,
saxon_dr#3806,11-Jun-18 08:10 PM,so the people here probalby share more similarity,
joazlazer#2041,11-Jun-18 08:11 PM,we're all CS / eng majors :OMEGALUL:,
brumeux#4293,11-Jun-18 08:11 PM,yeah i think its definitely a more homogenized group of ppl on discord,
saxon_dr#3806,11-Jun-18 08:11 PM,yeah,
saxon_dr#3806,11-Jun-18 08:11 PM,and also people here are more used to communicating on the internet so we know how to act i guess?,
brumeux#4293,11-Jun-18 08:11 PM,less likely to publicly start fights i think,
saxon_dr#3806,11-Jun-18 08:12 PM,like there are some social skills that you pick up on by being on discord and reddit a lot (and im my case 24/7 :OMEGALUL: ),
8726andrew#5709,11-Jun-18 08:12 PM,throwback to lerk,
brumeux#4293,11-Jun-18 08:12 PM,whats lerk,
MEE6#4876,11-Jun-18 08:12 PM,"GG @brumeux#4293, you just advanced to level 9!",
joazlazer#2041,11-Jun-18 08:12 PM,social skills :OMEGALUL:,
joazlazer#2041,11-Jun-18 08:13 PM,ive never heard of that discord server,
saxon_dr#3806,11-Jun-18 08:13 PM,lol,
8726andrew#5709,11-Jun-18 08:13 PM,he was a shitty troll that was on this server for far longer than he should've been,
saxon_dr#3806,11-Jun-18 08:13 PM,idk it sounds troll but i think virtual relationships require a different set of social skills than irl ones :k3llyShrug:,
joazlazer#2041,11-Jun-18 08:13 PM,glad I wasn't there for lerk :monkaS:,
saxon_dr#3806,11-Jun-18 08:13 PM,oof,
saxon_dr#3806,11-Jun-18 08:13 PM,yeah glad i wasn't there too,
saxon_dr#3806,11-Jun-18 08:14 PM,but then if i was here longer i would have more points and wouldn't have to worry about joseph 😡,
brumeux#4293,11-Jun-18 08:14 PM,rip me when i start trying to social network in person,
joazlazer#2041,11-Jun-18 08:14 PM,me too tho :moon2A:,
saxon_dr#3806,11-Jun-18 08:14 PM,:LUL:,
brumeux#4293,11-Jun-18 08:14 PM,discord skills wont save me,
joazlazer#2041,11-Jun-18 08:14 PM,me_irl,
saxon_dr#3806,11-Jun-18 08:14 PM,it's fine i think we're planning to do some irl meetup in the first two weeks of school,
saxon_dr#3806,11-Jun-18 08:14 PM,we can all be awkward irl together,
MKA#5877,11-Jun-18 08:16 PM,groupme sucks too,
KyotoKoto#5113,11-Jun-18 08:16 PM,"groupme= super normie , , discord= a bit less normie",
MEE6#4876,11-Jun-18 08:16 PM,"GG @KyotoKoto#5113, you just advanced to level 5!",
MKA#5877,11-Jun-18 08:16 PM,telegram > groupme,
8726andrew#5709,11-Jun-18 08:17 PM,using normie unironically :Thonk_transparent:,
joazlazer#2041,11-Jun-18 08:17 PM,i mean you're not wrong @KyotoKoto#5113,
MKA#5877,11-Jun-18 08:17 PM,yea,
MKA#5877,11-Jun-18 08:18 PM,its not hard to beat groupme though,
8726andrew#5709,11-Jun-18 08:18 PM,oof i can spell i promise,
joazlazer#2041,11-Jun-18 08:18 PM,we need a :ree: emote on this server :Thonk_transparent:,
brumeux#4293,11-Jun-18 08:18 PM,groupme is like texting when you dont trust people enough to give them your phone number,
KyotoKoto#5113,11-Jun-18 08:18 PM,@8726andrew#5709  i'm on /r/greentext often so i see the word normie a lot. i guess i just use the word more liberally now lol,
8726andrew#5709,11-Jun-18 08:19 PM,lol i dont actually care but using it outside of 4chan is pretty sketch,
brumeux#4293,11-Jun-18 08:19 PM,i thought it was ironic,
brumeux#4293,11-Jun-18 08:19 PM,. hopefully.,
8726andrew#5709,11-Jun-18 08:19 PM,group me is good for having big group chats for like classes and stuff,
8726andrew#5709,11-Jun-18 08:20 PM,like i had  a physics one last year,
Nobo#2748,11-Jun-18 08:20 PM,it only works there because people only use it for important things,
Nobo#2748,11-Jun-18 08:20 PM,or die,
8726andrew#5709,11-Jun-18 08:20 PM,or memes,
8726andrew#5709,11-Jun-18 08:20 PM,the memes are great,
Nobo#2748,11-Jun-18 08:20 PM,groupme is more efficient for study groups or tight-knit lab partners,
Nobo#2748,11-Jun-18 08:20 PM,since if you turn off notifcations on groupme anyways it becomes useless,
joazlazer#2041,11-Jun-18 08:21 PM,tbh,
8726andrew#5709,11-Jun-18 08:21 PM,if you turn off notifications you miss the memes though,
joazlazer#2041,11-Jun-18 08:22 PM,groupme memes,
joazlazer#2041,11-Jun-18 08:22 PM,:OMEGALUL:,
MKA#5877,11-Jun-18 08:22 PM,im gonna launch a revolution to overthrow groupme,
8726andrew#5709,11-Jun-18 08:22 PM,lol people just make memes and post them in the chat,
MKA#5877,11-Jun-18 08:22 PM,and get everyone to use something else,
8726andrew#5709,11-Jun-18 08:22 PM,"the ""meme"" button is cancer",
joazlazer#2041,11-Jun-18 08:24 PM,white caption memes are still funny in 2018,

brumeux#4293,12-Jun-18 07:47 PM,dual enrolled,
pnw#8833,12-Jun-18 07:47 PM,ah,
brumeux#4293,12-Jun-18 07:47 PM,the other link should work tho it looks like the same data,
brumeux#4293,12-Jun-18 07:47 PM,its where https://critique.gatech.edu/ gets their data,
pnw#8833,12-Jun-18 07:48 PM,yo why is Gatechs average gpa so low,
pnw#8833,12-Jun-18 07:48 PM,that's what scares me about tech,
brumeux#4293,12-Jun-18 07:49 PM,grade deflation,
pnw#8833,12-Jun-18 07:49 PM,"wait does georgia tech have A+, A-, B+, B-",
pnw#8833,12-Jun-18 07:50 PM,"or just A, B, C, D",
KyotoKoto#5113,12-Jun-18 07:50 PM,the latter,
pnw#8833,12-Jun-18 07:50 PM,are A's like 90%+ or a certain spot on the curve,
brumeux#4293,12-Jun-18 07:50 PM,but i think places like grad schools take gt's reputation into consideration when looking at gpa?,
brumeux#4293,12-Jun-18 07:51 PM,mostly 90%+ i think or at least thats what it was for all the freshmen classes i took,
pnw#8833,12-Jun-18 07:51 PM,I wish georgia tech gave what the standard deviation,
pnw#8833,12-Jun-18 07:51 PM,for gpa,
brumeux#4293,12-Jun-18 07:52 PM,its probably less grade deflation and more just not inflating grades cause i doubt profs would curve down,
brumeux#4293,12-Jun-18 07:52 PM,but yeah me too,
BradfordOfMars#9837,12-Jun-18 07:53 PM,It’s less of curving down and more of normalizing the grades,

thedragonlegacy#2854,12-Jun-18 08:03 PM,oof i tagged the wrong person,

joazlazer#2041,12-Jun-18 10:26 PM,georgia tech used sPonGeBoB sPeAk before it was even a meme :moon2EZ:,
joazlazer#2041,12-Jun-18 10:26 PM,also grade inflation :FeelsGoodMan:,
joazlazer#2041,12-Jun-18 10:27 PM,or is it just the selectivity of tech increasing?,
joazlazer#2041,12-Jun-18 10:27 PM,if they have a larger talent pool to pick from and are selecting the higher students then one would expect higher mean grades,
joazlazer#2041,12-Jun-18 10:27 PM,and the second graph seems to suggest that,
joazlazer#2041,12-Jun-18 10:28 PM,"that as mean SAT scores increase (supposedly standardized over time), grades are increasing",
joazlazer#2041,12-Jun-18 10:30 PM,so doesn't that seem to suggest a lack of grade inflation?,
joazlazer#2041,12-Jun-18 10:30 PM,and just the expected results of higher selectivity?,
joazlazer#2041,12-Jun-18 10:33 PM,can tech pls give us some more grade inflation,

Gadget246#0848,13-Jun-18 06:32 PM,"yo i realize this was a couple days ago but i've been offline for a couple days because technical difficulties so i'll respond to it anyways, what happened with the lgbt groupme is that a straight person joined and then someone in the chat kicked him, so he asked politely in the full groupme why he had been kicked, nobody was responding, so i offered to join the lgbt chat and ask them why they had kicked him (and then did so after he said yes) , i got back from one of them that he had been kicked because they were scared he was a troll (he changed the LGBT in the chat name to be LGBTQ and the fact that he joined and immediately changed the name looked suspicious) but since he was being civil in the other chat he could be re-added if he wanted, I said that he would like to be re-added but that I would leave it up to people who had been in the chat longer since I didn't want to invade their space, then someone else said in both chats that straight people weren't allowed in the chat and kicked me from the chat (before asking whether i was straight) and then went on to be aggressive towards the person who had previously been kicked, I offered to make a GSA chat where anyone was welcome and made a poll to gauge interest in such a chat (in the full group) but the results from my poll somehow didn't ever show up for me (idk if my groupme bugged out or what) so i didn't end up making said chat, and then eventually the LGBT chat moved to be a snapchat group so they can be more selective about who joins, basically it was just groupme being a mess",

Continue and stay until 6 PM on Day 2 for academic advising, course registration, and additional presentations.

8726andrew#5709,15-Jun-18 09:02 AM,My understanding is that it occasionally goes down for one reason or another,
saxon_dr#3806,15-Jun-18 09:05 AM,yeah that's what i meant,
saxon_dr#3806,15-Jun-18 09:06 AM,it goes down sometimes but when it's not down it's really fast,
joazlazer#2041,15-Jun-18 10:30 AM,it disconnects when im walking across campus smh,

joazlazer#2041,15-Jun-18 11:14 AM,now that's for summer faset so it might be different from fall faset (tho probably not that much different),
Chris#7693,15-Jun-18 12:13 PM,"basically, when the wifi works its nutty, but sometimes it just doesnt work",
Chris#7693,15-Jun-18 12:14 PM,overall the whining is really exaggerated,
thedragonlegacy#2854,15-Jun-18 12:27 PM,@Chris#7693  what year are you in?,
Chris#7693,15-Jun-18 12:28 PM,ill be a third year in the fall,

Chafos#1781,15-Jun-18 01:18 PM,haha figured that was why,
Chafos#1781,15-Jun-18 01:18 PM,But you could have gotten more xp if you explained the context,
Chafos#1781,15-Jun-18 01:18 PM,instead of giving me the time to figure it out,
joazlazer#2041,15-Jun-18 01:19 PM,I had to wait 1 minute between messages to maximize XP output 😤,
Chafos#1781,15-Jun-18 01:20 PM,o,

joazlazer#2041,15-Jun-18 01:22 PM,but if I type two messages within a minute of each other I only get xp for one of them,

Arya201#6452,15-Jun-18 01:39 PM,us visa was bugging me terribly,
Arya201#6452,15-Jun-18 01:39 PM,It's such a long lengthy and scary process,
Chafos#1781,15-Jun-18 01:39 PM,that sounds quite unfortunate,
Chafos#1781,15-Jun-18 01:40 PM,the us government is annoying in general,
Arya201#6452,15-Jun-18 01:40 PM,I have an interview for the visa this 18th,
Arya201#6452,15-Jun-18 01:41 PM,I'm scared to death,

Arya201#6452,15-Jun-18 01:41 PM,A visa interview,
Arya201#6452,15-Jun-18 01:41 PM,And they ask the weirdest of questions,
Arya201#6452,15-Jun-18 01:41 PM,One of my friends was asked something like this,
Arya201#6452,15-Jun-18 01:42 PM,"""How will i know you will come back after graduating?""",
Chafos#1781,15-Jun-18 01:42 PM,that is weird,

efank#9753,15-Jun-18 01:43 PM,"chafos, idk tbf",
efank#9753,15-Jun-18 01:43 PM,i guess it is still fair game,
efank#9753,15-Jun-18 01:43 PM,standard fare stuff? like still national security interests,
efank#9753,15-Jun-18 01:44 PM,it's more understandable,
Arya201#6452,15-Jun-18 01:44 PM,They ask the same questions overall,
efank#9753,15-Jun-18 01:44 PM,my dad told me to expect the process,
efank#9753,15-Jun-18 01:44 PM,to be a pain in the ass,
efank#9753,15-Jun-18 01:44 PM,so like the questions that got thrown at u i would knda understand and expect i guess,
efank#9753,15-Jun-18 01:44 PM,but then they're dumb q's,
efank#9753,15-Jun-18 01:44 PM,i think ofc u'd say no?,
Arya201#6452,15-Jun-18 01:44 PM,"But you just want to convince them that no matter what, your intentions are to come back to your home counrry",
efank#9753,15-Jun-18 01:44 PM,yeah ^,
efank#9753,15-Jun-18 01:44 PM,i think it's just,
efank#9753,15-Jun-18 01:44 PM,making that clear,
efank#9753,15-Jun-18 01:45 PM,wait,
Arya201#6452,15-Jun-18 01:45 PM,Like they asked a friend to show any property holding good monetary value here,
efank#9753,15-Jun-18 01:45 PM,do you have to leave your passport here?,
angrymunch739#7866,15-Jun-18 01:45 PM,What things did you guys get from faset?,

Arya201#6452,15-Jun-18 01:45 PM,Yeah leave the passport there,
Arya201#6452,15-Jun-18 01:46 PM,The only good thing is they tell u if u got a visa or got rejected on spot,
angrymunch739#7866,15-Jun-18 01:46 PM,@joazlazer#2041 what things did you guys get at faset?,
Arya201#6452,15-Jun-18 01:46 PM,On dont expect the passport in 2 days,
Arya201#6452,15-Jun-18 01:46 PM,Usually they keep it for a week,
Arya201#6452,15-Jun-18 01:46 PM,Unless there's a very few people applying for visa at the same time,
joazlazer#2041,15-Jun-18 01:47 PM,@angrymunch739#7866 as far as like free stuff?,

efank#9753,15-Jun-18 01:48 PM,@angrymunch739#7866  i think they specifically say,
efank#9753,15-Jun-18 01:48 PM,when you pay for FASET,
efank#9753,15-Jun-18 01:48 PM,part of the fee goes towards ur shirt,

bopas2#1774,15-Jun-18 01:50 PM,"the chat i sent is the main one, if that's what you're worried about",
efank#9753,15-Jun-18 01:50 PM,or i should reschedule right,
efank#9753,15-Jun-18 01:50 PM,nah not too worried,

Arya201#6452,15-Jun-18 01:50 PM,I think it's better to play safe Ethan,
Arya201#6452,15-Jun-18 01:50 PM,I know people who got their passports in 2 days and most in a week or so,
bopas2#1774,15-Jun-18 01:51 PM,i'm not worrying about classes until i get ap scores,
Chafos#1781,15-Jun-18 01:51 PM,"chem II, linear algebra, cs 1331, and some of the required general classes",
Chafos#1781,15-Jun-18 01:52 PM,i think there may have been a few more but that's what i distinctly recall,
Chafos#1781,15-Jun-18 01:52 PM,but yeah depending on how physics/bio credit works out i might not even have to take chem 2 so I agree to an extent with @bopas2#1774,
bopas2#1774,15-Jun-18 01:53 PM,i'm pretty sure i will never have to study chem or bio again and i'm so happy,
Arya201#6452,15-Jun-18 01:54 PM,It's my birthday in 7 minutes!!!!!,

brumeux#4293,15-Jun-18 01:56 PM,so how many credit hours are you thinking of taking?,
brumeux#4293,15-Jun-18 01:56 PM,@Chafos#1781,

brumeux#4293,15-Jun-18 01:57 PM,so you could probably get there with 4 or 5 classes ig,
MKA#5877,15-Jun-18 01:57 PM,yeah 4 or 5 classes depending on how many credits they are,
MKA#5877,15-Jun-18 01:58 PM,"im hoping to take 5 classes (comp 2, linear algebra, CS 1331, health, CS 1100) which is 13 credits",
MKA#5877,15-Jun-18 01:58 PM,probably wont get health tho lol,
Chafos#1781,15-Jun-18 01:59 PM,first semester i'll probably do 15 credits,
brumeux#4293,15-Jun-18 01:59 PM,health being apph ? i thought it was pretty easy to find a seat,
MKA#5877,15-Jun-18 01:59 PM,yeah APPH,
MKA#5877,15-Jun-18 02:00 PM,the problem is upperclassmen taking spots bc they didnt take it as freshmen bc upperclassmen took their spots,
MKA#5877,15-Jun-18 02:00 PM,idk thats just the impression i got from reddit,
brumeux#4293,15-Jun-18 02:01 PM,oh rip i was looking at the one where you have to work out too (1050),
brumeux#4293,15-Jun-18 02:01 PM,there are spots there bc im assuming. people dont wanna,
brumeux#4293,15-Jun-18 02:01 PM,lololol yeah theres like 5 seats left,
Chafos#1781,15-Jun-18 02:01 PM,yeah hard pass,
MKA#5877,15-Jun-18 02:02 PM,i was gonna try to take 1050 too,
MKA#5877,15-Jun-18 02:03 PM,im in honors so i was hoping that there would be more seats in the honors-specific section for it,
MKA#5877,15-Jun-18 02:03 PM,but nope 5 or 6 seats left in each of the 3 types,

brumeux#4293,15-Jun-18 02:30 PM,i heard spain fired their head coach right before the game so we'll see if it pays off,
Chafos#1781,15-Jun-18 02:31 PM,huh thats an interesting move,
MKA#5877,15-Jun-18 02:33 PM,they fired him like two days ago right before the world cup started,
MKA#5877,15-Jun-18 02:33 PM,he was leaving after the world cup anyway for real madrid,
MKA#5877,15-Jun-18 02:34 PM,but uh instead they decided to bring in a New Guy™ for the biggest international competition,

waffle.dynasty#2740,17-Jun-18 01:35 PM,That chat has been a mess today,
Snowfish#4289,17-Jun-18 01:41 PM,i actually hate both sides of that conversation,
Snowfish#4289,17-Jun-18 01:41 PM,that’s very impressive,
Snowfish#4289,17-Jun-18 01:42 PM,now i kinda wish i was in that chat because i love spicy drama,
joazlazer#2041,17-Jun-18 01:42 PM,me too tbh,
joazlazer#2041,17-Jun-18 01:42 PM,but andrew was basically asserting that its poor peoples fault that theyre poor,
joazlazer#2041,17-Jun-18 01:43 PM,and theres some truth to that,
joazlazer#2041,17-Jun-18 01:43 PM,but theres so much more to it,
Snowfish#4289,17-Jun-18 01:43 PM,it really depends on how you approach it,
joazlazer#2041,17-Jun-18 01:43 PM,if youre poor just dont be 4head,
Snowfish#4289,17-Jun-18 01:43 PM,yeah,
Snowfish#4289,17-Jun-18 01:43 PM,if you’re like “the welfare system is all kinds of fucked and actually promoted unemployment” that’s ok,
Snowfish#4289,17-Jun-18 01:43 PM,“just buy a house 4Head”,
Snowfish#4289,17-Jun-18 01:45 PM,but going on about privilege is also fucking stupid,

Snowfish#4289,17-Jun-18 01:46 PM,yeah that’s usually how it goes,
Snowfish#4289,17-Jun-18 01:46 PM,it’s like time tickets released and three days later they actually start,
Snowfish#4289,17-Jun-18 01:46 PM,"if you don’t have a time ticket, i wouldn’t worry about it",
pnw#8833,17-Jun-18 01:47 PM,how do i know if i habve one,
Snowfish#4289,17-Jun-18 01:47 PM,"if you have access to buzzport, go to registration",
Snowfish#4289,17-Jun-18 01:47 PM,add/drop classes,
Snowfish#4289,17-Jun-18 01:48 PM,and if it’s red text that’s like NO ACCESS then you don’t have a time ticket,
pnw#8833,17-Jun-18 01:49 PM,i dont see add/drop classes as an option,

pnw#8833,17-Jun-18 01:54 PM,acording to the website,
pnw#8833,17-Jun-18 01:54 PM,i thought that meant i should already have my tickets,
pnw#8833,17-Jun-18 01:54 PM,but apparently its just when tickets start to come out,
waffle.dynasty#2740,17-Jun-18 01:54 PM,^yeah,
waffle.dynasty#2740,17-Jun-18 01:54 PM,You're ticket will give you a time to self select your room,
waffle.dynasty#2740,17-Jun-18 01:56 PM,There's 10 days give for self select so it's not like time is at a shortage,
8726andrew#5709,17-Jun-18 01:56 PM,@joazlazer#2041 was that from the “committed” chat or whatever,
joazlazer#2041,17-Jun-18 01:58 PM,no in the GT '22 groupchat,
joazlazer#2041,17-Jun-18 01:58 PM,basically the same thing at this point tho,
8726andrew#5709,17-Jun-18 01:58 PM,Why even have a committed one then,
waffle.dynasty#2740,17-Jun-18 01:58 PM,They changed the name of the committed group to GT'22,
8726andrew#5709,17-Jun-18 01:58 PM,Lol I left that one bc it’s just people asking to get added to the committed chat or whatever,
joazlazer#2041,17-Jun-18 01:58 PM,oh,
joazlazer#2041,17-Jun-18 01:59 PM,ok nvm I'm stupid,

8726andrew#5709,17-Jun-18 02:02 PM,What does he even have to flex,
joazlazer#2041,17-Jun-18 02:02 PM,apparently he made a bunch of money off of crypto and bought some expensive shit or smth,
8726andrew#5709,17-Jun-18 02:03 PM,Probably daddy’s money or something,
joazlazer#2041,17-Jun-18 02:03 PM,and iirc he said he got into stanford and a bunch of ivies,

Snowfish#4289,17-Jun-18 02:08 PM,it was like the kind of troll that is honestly just bleeding his desperation for attention,
8726andrew#5709,17-Jun-18 02:08 PM,Cheers,
Snowfish#4289,17-Jun-18 02:08 PM,i let him stay for so long because i genuinely felt bad for the guy,

Gadget246#0848,17-Jun-18 03:28 PM,Joseph's screenshot of GT'22 is a classic example of what happens when people who aren't normally internet dwellers meet shitposters for the first time,

Gadget246#0848,17-Jun-18 03:29 PM,inb4 my statement applies to that one as well lol,

joazlazer#2041,17-Jun-18 03:48 PM,unless that makes him a grandmaster shitposter,

suyashr99#7560,17-Jun-18 05:15 PM,I can't lie that he's kind of creepy but that chat just devolved into bully Andrew and push him to do weirder shit,
Gadget246#0848,17-Jun-18 05:16 PM,I was going to argue that this was the light side but since discord is a dark theme and groupme is a light theme I think I'm going to not start that argument lol,
thedragonlegacy#2854,17-Jun-18 05:16 PM,: /,
suyashr99#7560,17-Jun-18 05:16 PM,Well they both have dark themes,

8726andrew#5709,17-Jun-18 05:38 PM,lowkey i was kinda worried i'd never find out your actual name before like FASET so id have no idea who you were if i went by the esports table lol @Snowfish#4289,
8726andrew#5709,17-Jun-18 05:38 PM,frick,
Snowfish#4289,17-Jun-18 05:38 PM,it’s ok you have the esports members to take care of you ❤️❤️,
suyashr99#7560,17-Jun-18 05:38 PM,The dude that had a your lie in April pfp?,
thedragonlegacy#2854,17-Jun-18 05:38 PM,oh,
thedragonlegacy#2854,17-Jun-18 05:38 PM,i kinda feel like kicking them off,
thedragonlegacy#2854,17-Jun-18 05:38 PM,lol,
bopas2#1774,17-Jun-18 05:38 PM,I’m salty that the league of legends discord is dead : (,
Snowfish#4289,17-Jun-18 05:39 PM,:monkaS:,
Snowfish#4289,17-Jun-18 05:39 PM,the GT one?,
bopas2#1774,17-Jun-18 05:39 PM,ye,
Snowfish#4289,17-Jun-18 05:39 PM,they usually aren’t that active in the summer,
Snowfish#4289,17-Jun-18 05:39 PM,the esports club has plenty of shitposting tho,
suyashr99#7560,17-Jun-18 05:39 PM,Why does Katie get to call us weird,
waffle.dynasty#2740,17-Jun-18 05:39 PM,This is a good discord. Much better than the groupme. You guys rock,
thedragonlegacy#2854,17-Jun-18 05:40 PM,smh i tried explaining but then realized it was weird,
Chafos#1781,17-Jun-18 05:40 PM,Katie is an interesting character,
MKA#5877,17-Jun-18 05:40 PM,I used to look at the groupme even though I muted it but haha not anymore,
MKA#5877,17-Jun-18 05:40 PM,sounds like it went to shit today,
Chafos#1781,17-Jun-18 05:41 PM,Woah @joazlazer#2041 you changed your pfp,
bopas2#1774,17-Jun-18 05:41 PM,I feel like there are different factions in the groupme,
suyashr99#7560,17-Jun-18 05:41 PM,It's always been shit,
thedragonlegacy#2854,17-Jun-18 05:41 PM,same^ but now i'll be more active cuz i gotta actually admin : >,
thedragonlegacy#2854,17-Jun-18 05:41 PM,":,>",
suyashr99#7560,17-Jun-18 05:41 PM,I've been in all of them since early action came out,
joazlazer#2041,17-Jun-18 05:41 PM,I did chafos,
bopas2#1774,17-Jun-18 05:41 PM,“I'll be honest I joined the discord once and everyone had an anime profile pic I was impressed at the coordination “ lmaooo,
thedragonlegacy#2854,17-Jun-18 05:42 PM,im ded,
thedragonlegacy#2854,17-Jun-18 05:42 PM,lol,
suyashr99#7560,17-Jun-18 05:42 PM,@Snowfish#4289 are you a FASET leader?,
Snowfish#4289,17-Jun-18 05:42 PM,no just at the org fair,
Gadget246#0848,17-Jun-18 05:42 PM,"alright my quest to find a thing and then take a picture and then upload the picture and then download the picture and then upload the picture again is now complete., I too have a hat.

Snowfish#4289,17-Jun-18 05:42 PM,i’m gonna keep saying that joke until the day i die,
Snowfish#4289,17-Jun-18 05:42 PM,wow,
bopas2#1774,17-Jun-18 05:42 PM,beautiful,
thedragonlegacy#2854,17-Jun-18 05:42 PM,"""I too""",
thedragonlegacy#2854,17-Jun-18 05:42 PM,lol,
suyashr99#7560,17-Jun-18 05:42 PM,I'm joining esports club for smash,
joazlazer#2041,17-Jun-18 05:42 PM,schuler is not a gear???????,
Snowfish#4289,17-Jun-18 05:42 PM,were like spirit animals,
thedragonlegacy#2854,17-Jun-18 05:42 PM,make it your profile pic on groupme,
thedragonlegacy#2854,17-Jun-18 05:43 PM,xd,
Chafos#1781,17-Jun-18 05:43 PM,wow everyone’s doxxing themselves like crazy,
MKA#5877,17-Jun-18 05:43 PM,sounds fun,
Snowfish#4289,17-Jun-18 05:43 PM,turns out if you go to the same college it’s kinda hard not to doxx yourself,
Chafos#1781,17-Jun-18 05:44 PM,"yeah ik, just thought it was funny it was happening all at once",
Gadget246#0848,17-Jun-18 05:45 PM,I like to have the same profile pic on everything. Which usually works because my screenname is nearly always Gadget246. But now that I'm in a couple chats where i use my real name it's slightly weird,
bopas2#1774,17-Jun-18 05:46 PM,who is discord?,
Lennox#3038,17-Jun-18 05:46 PM,I have different names and pictures for like everything,
bopas2#1774,17-Jun-18 05:46 PM,we should make them admin,
thedragonlegacy#2854,17-Jun-18 05:46 PM,lol,
waffle.dynasty#2740,17-Jun-18 05:46 PM,I barely have any digital pics of myself so my profile pic is almost always the same,
thedragonlegacy#2854,17-Jun-18 05:46 PM,i hope that's a joke,
joazlazer#2041,17-Jun-18 05:47 PM,who is this discord guy I keep hearing about?,
thedragonlegacy#2854,17-Jun-18 05:47 PM,"talking about the ""who is discord""",
Chafos#1781,17-Jun-18 05:47 PM,Guys who is groupme,
Chafos#1781,17-Jun-18 05:47 PM,I’m so confused,
thedragonlegacy#2854,17-Jun-18 05:47 PM,what is this roasting culture,
suyashr99#7560,17-Jun-18 05:48 PM,I don't get the appeal of Mustafa,
Gadget246#0848,17-Jun-18 05:48 PM,same waffle.dynasty   I usually make an effort to avoid people having my picture because I've seen some people dump their folders of pictures of people and prefer to be able to laugh from the sidelines,
MKA#5877,17-Jun-18 05:48 PM,i never used my real name on discord lol,
suyashr99#7560,17-Jun-18 05:48 PM,And his roasts,
Chafos#1781,17-Jun-18 05:48 PM,I think mustafa is hilarious,
Chafos#1781,17-Jun-18 05:48 PM,but I think a lot is funny so may be just me,
thedragonlegacy#2854,17-Jun-18 05:48 PM,ya i dont get him either,
suyashr99#7560,17-Jun-18 05:48 PM,I think it's funny at times too,
suyashr99#7560,17-Jun-18 05:48 PM,But it's just kinda not at others,
joazlazer#2041,17-Jun-18 05:48 PM,mustafa is de guud roastmasta,
suyashr99#7560,17-Jun-18 05:48 PM,Like when he's talking about making lean or whatever,
joazlazer#2041,17-Jun-18 05:48 PM,12 btw,
joazlazer#2041,17-Jun-18 05:48 PM,:haHAA:,
waffle.dynasty#2740,17-Jun-18 05:48 PM,"I thought he was annoying, but now I think he's funny now",
thedragonlegacy#2854,17-Jun-18 05:49 PM,fr?,
suyashr99#7560,17-Jun-18 05:49 PM,I don't take anything he says seriously,
MKA#5877,17-Jun-18 05:49 PM,^,
waffle.dynasty#2740,17-Jun-18 05:49 PM,Yeah it's kinda obvious to me that he's not serious,
MKA#5877,17-Jun-18 05:49 PM,same I just view it as him taking everything as a joke,
waffle.dynasty#2740,17-Jun-18 05:49 PM,Andrew on the other hand...,
suyashr99#7560,17-Jun-18 05:50 PM,I mean like all the flexing,
suyashr99#7560,17-Jun-18 05:50 PM,"I never take ""roasts"" seriously",
Chafos#1781,17-Jun-18 05:50 PM,ugh I really wish this current student dude had a different first name,
joazlazer#2041,17-Jun-18 05:50 PM,who lol,
joazlazer#2041,17-Jun-18 05:50 PM,Pierce?,
Chafos#1781,17-Jun-18 05:50 PM,Andrew,
joazlazer#2041,17-Jun-18 05:50 PM,oh,
joazlazer#2041,17-Jun-18 05:50 PM,lmaoo,
suyashr99#7560,17-Jun-18 05:50 PM,Lol is Katie tryin to start things,
MKA#5877,17-Jun-18 05:50 PM,haha that’s what you get for going by a common first name,
suyashr99#7560,17-Jun-18 05:51 PM,Just be like me and have an uncommon name even for an Indian,
joazlazer#2041,17-Jun-18 05:51 PM,guys there are actually like 10 josephs in my hall,
Chafos#1781,17-Jun-18 05:51 PM,ok I liked Katie a decent amount before that,
Chafos#1781,17-Jun-18 05:51 PM,she needs to back off tho,
thedragonlegacy#2854,17-Jun-18 05:51 PM,LOL,
joazlazer#2041,17-Jun-18 05:51 PM,im not unique,
joazlazer#2041,17-Jun-18 05:51 PM,:PepeHands:,
Chafos#1781,17-Jun-18 05:51 PM,or maybe marissa will roast her into oblivion back if she tries,
bopas2#1774,17-Jun-18 05:51 PM,"Marissa, discord fam has ur back if you start getting roasted",
Chafos#1781,17-Jun-18 05:51 PM,idk,
thedragonlegacy#2854,17-Jun-18 05:52 PM,aye fam thanks ☺,
thedragonlegacy#2854,17-Jun-18 05:52 PM,who r these thirsty thots for roasty thoughts,
Gadget246#0848,17-Jun-18 05:53 PM,I never have to worry about having the same name as people :EZ:,
joazlazer#2041,17-Jun-18 05:53 PM,we'll just raid their chat and act weird,
suyashr99#7560,17-Jun-18 05:53 PM,I have some good roasts under my sleeve but I need the self confidence to send them,
joazlazer#2041,17-Jun-18 05:53 PM,that'll scare them,
Gadget246#0848,17-Jun-18 05:53 PM,"on the other hand, every time I give someone my first name they say ""And what's your first name?""",
Gadget246#0848,17-Jun-18 05:53 PM,:PepeHands:,
Chafos#1781,17-Jun-18 05:54 PM,haha I avoid roasting at all times now,
Chafos#1781,17-Jun-18 05:54 PM,It got way too spicy in a school group chat with me once and it turned into actual drama,
suyashr99#7560,17-Jun-18 05:54 PM,Same,
Chafos#1781,17-Jun-18 05:54 PM,and then I looked like a dick,
waffle.dynasty#2740,17-Jun-18 05:54 PM,I'm just there for those likes,
Lennox#3038,17-Jun-18 05:55 PM,likes makes groupme seem so chaotic,
suyashr99#7560,17-Jun-18 05:55 PM,Yeah,
Lennox#3038,17-Jun-18 05:55 PM,brings lurkers to the forefront,
Gadget246#0848,17-Jun-18 05:55 PM,"i have personally never understood purposefully roasting people or seeking to be roasted or egging on people to roast others, casual roasting and clapbacks in a small group of friends can be fun, but the more serious/intentional it is the less fun it is imo",
Chafos#1781,17-Jun-18 05:55 PM,it’s just entertaining I think,
Chafos#1781,17-Jun-18 05:55 PM,except it’s less so when it has to do with actual serious topics,
KyotoKoto#5113,17-Jun-18 05:56 PM,"you feel superior because you're essentially power tripping (to varying degrees), , something something putting down others to make yourself feel better.",
8726andrew#5709,17-Jun-18 05:56 PM,hey my profile pic isnt anime,
suyashr99#7560,17-Jun-18 05:56 PM,Most of the times its because of crippling insecurities,
8726andrew#5709,17-Jun-18 05:56 PM,its deviant art i think,
joazlazer#2041,17-Jun-18 05:56 PM,roasting is really :haHAA: to me but idk,
thedragonlegacy#2854,17-Jun-18 05:56 PM,i roasted a ginger a few times throughout senior year... :FeelsBadMan: he thought i actually hated him. :FeelsBadMan: never again shall i roast ppl that dont know me as well,
suyashr99#7560,17-Jun-18 05:56 PM,That's why I used to be good at roasts,
8726andrew#5709,17-Jun-18 05:56 PM,if you cant dish it out dont take it,
Samsung#6949,17-Jun-18 05:56 PM,I feel like people ask to be roasted too so that they can confirm that they know what people don't like about them,
Samsung#6949,17-Jun-18 05:57 PM,The issue comes when there's more wrong with them than they thought,
waffle.dynasty#2740,17-Jun-18 05:57 PM,They gm took the roasting too far,
bopas2#1774,17-Jun-18 05:57 PM,"Also, I think a lot of people are forgetting how many ppl are actually in the groupme and how many questionable first impressions they may be making",
thedragonlegacy#2854,17-Jun-18 05:57 PM,^^^,
8726andrew#5709,17-Jun-18 05:57 PM,if someone roasts on you either you take it bc its legit and theres no comeback or you roast back,
suyashr99#7560,17-Jun-18 05:57 PM,"Lol pierce ""the Thots come out at night"" when talking about Katie",
thedragonlegacy#2854,17-Jun-18 05:57 PM,^^^,
joazlazer#2041,17-Jun-18 05:57 PM,if I act weird in the discord does that apply to me too @bopas2#1774 :PepeHands:,
Gadget246#0848,17-Jun-18 05:57 PM,"I like your profile pic andrew, it's cute",
Samsung#6949,17-Jun-18 05:57 PM,Oh this was about the gm,
Samsung#6949,17-Jun-18 05:57 PM,I was on vacation and just got back lol,
thedragonlegacy#2854,17-Jun-18 05:58 PM,oh,
thedragonlegacy#2854,17-Jun-18 05:58 PM,nvm,
Chafos#1781,17-Jun-18 05:58 PM,maybe I’ll change my pfp on here soon,
Chafos#1781,17-Jun-18 05:58 PM,idk tho,
Chafos#1781,17-Jun-18 05:58 PM,been the same since I got discord,
Samsung#6949,17-Jun-18 05:58 PM,I feel like Im creating an association between the face on my pfp and who I am,
Samsung#6949,17-Jun-18 05:58 PM,Which prob isn't great,
8726andrew#5709,17-Jun-18 05:58 PM,@Gadget246#0848 cant even tell who you're talking to lol too many people go by andrew but im the one with it in my user,
bopas2#1774,17-Jun-18 05:58 PM,"nah, the discord’s a bit different imo @joazlazer#2041",
suyashr99#7560,17-Jun-18 05:59 PM,Discord is less fake tbh,
thedragonlegacy#2854,17-Jun-18 05:59 PM,wdym,
8726andrew#5709,17-Jun-18 05:59 PM,one of my friend's profile pics is amazing,
suyashr99#7560,17-Jun-18 06:00 PM,"I feel really fake in the groupme, that's why I only answer questions",
8726andrew#5709,17-Jun-18 06:00 PM,its this really shitty off brand sandy and i'd post it if i could,
8726andrew#5709,17-Jun-18 06:00 PM,its glorious,
Samsung#6949,17-Jun-18 06:00 PM,I just feel like by even having Discord we're all like in this sort of related group already,
Samsung#6949,17-Jun-18 06:00 PM,Which makes it easier to talk,
Chafos#1781,17-Jun-18 06:00 PM,yeah groupme 90% of the time I’m just lurking,
Chafos#1781,17-Jun-18 06:00 PM,so I kinda feel that,
Gadget246#0848,17-Jun-18 06:00 PM,I was talking to you @8726andrew#5709,
8726andrew#5709,17-Jun-18 06:01 PM,oh thanks bro,
Chafos#1781,17-Jun-18 06:01 PM,yeah not mine lmao,
8726andrew#5709,17-Jun-18 06:01 PM,idk man looks p cute to me,
Chafos#1781,17-Jun-18 06:01 PM,haha,
waffle.dynasty#2740,17-Jun-18 06:01 PM,The group me is too big which is the problem,
waffle.dynasty#2740,17-Jun-18 06:01 PM,This discord is a nice size,
Chafos#1781,17-Jun-18 06:01 PM,actually I don’t think it’s as active as it should be for that many people,
Gadget246#0848,17-Jun-18 06:01 PM,aw yeah that lightning -- super cute 😂,
Chafos#1781,17-Jun-18 06:01 PM,it surprises me the hiatuses that occur there,
8726andrew#5709,17-Jun-18 06:02 PM,yeah this is the most active we've been in a long while,
suyashr99#7560,17-Jun-18 06:02 PM,Its only 5 active people and 20 semi active people,
Chafos#1781,17-Jun-18 06:02 PM,but it does make it harder to remember people,
Gadget246#0848,17-Jun-18 06:02 PM,"yeah i think most people muted the gm, i know i did",
Gadget246#0848,17-Jun-18 06:02 PM,"i g2g for a while, bbl",
thedragonlegacy#2854,17-Jun-18 06:02 PM,"oh yeah, ping me on discord if ppl are weird on groupme. it'd be nice to have another pair of eyes since i'm interning full-time.",
suyashr99#7560,17-Jun-18 06:02 PM,I'm technically one of the semi active,
suyashr99#7560,17-Jun-18 06:02 PM,@thedragonlegacy#2854 gotchu I basically watch that chat all day,
Chafos#1781,17-Jun-18 06:02 PM,@thedragonlegacy#2854 I’ll do that as well,
thedragonlegacy#2854,17-Jun-18 06:02 PM,thanks!!,
waffle.dynasty#2740,17-Jun-18 06:03 PM,@Chafos#1781 you're probably right. Discord has a certain type of people that use it so that's probably why,
bopas2#1774,17-Jun-18 06:04 PM,"Also, there is better chat organization, moderation and record keeping",
waffle.dynasty#2740,17-Jun-18 06:05 PM,^,
thedragonlegacy#2854,17-Jun-18 06:05 PM,the moderation bots are much better,
joazlazer#2041,17-Jun-18 06:05 PM,when you realize you sent a questionable message you can delete it :FeelsGoodMan:,
thedragonlegacy#2854,17-Jun-18 06:05 PM,xDD,
Chafos#1781,17-Jun-18 06:05 PM,discord beats everything basically at this point,
suyashr99#7560,17-Jun-18 06:05 PM,That too,
suyashr99#7560,17-Jun-18 06:05 PM,Deleting is key,

suyashr99#7560,17-Jun-18 06:05 PM,Like I low-key want to send this,
thedragonlegacy#2854,17-Jun-18 06:06 PM,XDD,
Samsung#6949,17-Jun-18 06:06 PM,But steam has updated their chat ui!!!! :kappa:,
8726andrew#5709,17-Jun-18 06:06 PM,editing is also useful,
suyashr99#7560,17-Jun-18 06:06 PM,In the groupme just for the memes,
Chafos#1781,17-Jun-18 06:06 PM,I use deleting so much on discord,
suyashr99#7560,17-Jun-18 06:06 PM,But I'm too scared,
Chafos#1781,17-Jun-18 06:06 PM,and editing,
thedragonlegacy#2854,17-Jun-18 06:06 PM,just do it lol,
Chafos#1781,17-Jun-18 06:06 PM,you won’t,
thedragonlegacy#2854,17-Jun-18 06:06 PM,"there are people that post very, very questionable images on there",
thedragonlegacy#2854,17-Jun-18 06:06 PM,you're good fam,
suyashr99#7560,17-Jun-18 06:06 PM,Peer pressure it is,
bopas2#1774,17-Jun-18 06:07 PM,just send it without context,
thedragonlegacy#2854,17-Jun-18 06:07 PM,someone posted a child offender screenshot and i was like :haHAA:  ???,
thedragonlegacy#2854,17-Jun-18 06:07 PM,"LO, OO, LL",

thedragonlegacy#2854,17-Jun-18 06:07 PM,ahh he posted it on the main chat on accident,
8726andrew#5709,17-Jun-18 06:08 PM,i think  the oops wrong chat makes it better,
thedragonlegacy#2854,17-Jun-18 06:08 PM,^^^,
suyashr99#7560,17-Jun-18 06:08 PM,Lol no,
suyashr99#7560,17-Jun-18 06:08 PM,The oops wrong chat was strategic,

KyotoKoto#5113,17-Jun-18 07:11 PM,it sounds like we need to join together to open a decent boba place on tech's campus and rake in that 💸,
suyashr99#7560,17-Jun-18 07:11 PM,Coz tecg taco sucks ass,
suyashr99#7560,17-Jun-18 07:12 PM,Sublime and blue donkey should help me survive until boba arrives,
waffle.dynasty#2740,17-Jun-18 07:13 PM,This convo is so weird to me. I only drink water and milk,

bopas2#1774,17-Jun-18 07:14 PM,how much would it cost to have the upperclassmen/alums create a list of good food spots and/or Atlanta must-sees for us incoming ppl?,
KyotoKoto#5113,17-Jun-18 07:14 PM,"free?  there are already guides out there, you just gotta look, , check /r/gatech",

suyashr99#7560,17-Jun-18 07:15 PM,@waffle.dynasty#2740 i mostly drink water and milk id rather just drink dessert than eat it,
waffle.dynasty#2740,17-Jun-18 07:15 PM,There's one for discounts,
waffle.dynasty#2740,17-Jun-18 07:16 PM,Ahhhhhh so boba is a dessert,
waffle.dynasty#2740,17-Jun-18 07:16 PM,I was thinking it's like coffee,
suyashr99#7560,17-Jun-18 07:16 PM,It is,
suyashr99#7560,17-Jun-18 07:16 PM,I treat it like dessert,

waffle.dynasty#2740,17-Jun-18 07:21 PM,Brittain Dining 😫💦,
KyotoKoto#5113,17-Jun-18 07:21 PM,oh I've been there actually lmao it gives off kind of an edgy vibe lol,
suyashr99#7560,17-Jun-18 07:21 PM,I'd take Brittain over west village. Everyone seems to hate it with a burning passion,
suyashr99#7560,17-Jun-18 07:22 PM,I was originally slated to live on West because quiet and all but I decided to go east coz I comitted early enough for Glenn/Towers,
thedragonlegacy#2854,17-Jun-18 07:24 PM,west village seemed fine,
waffle.dynasty#2740,17-Jun-18 07:28 PM,^I like the way it's not a buffet too,
thedragonlegacy#2854,17-Jun-18 07:33 PM,"also, im discussing with dylan (main GC owner) about andrew",
suyashr99#7560,17-Jun-18 07:33 PM,He has some issues btw,
Rye#0666,17-Jun-18 07:33 PM,Is this our Andrew?,
thedragonlegacy#2854,17-Jun-18 07:34 PM,no,
thedragonlegacy#2854,17-Jun-18 07:34 PM,groupme wilder,
Rye#0666,17-Jun-18 07:34 PM,Okay lol,
suyashr99#7560,17-Jun-18 07:34 PM,I talked to him and said he should probably take a break from the GC and then when he said something about  not feeling mentally well,
thedragonlegacy#2854,17-Jun-18 07:35 PM,"my thoughts are to remove his admin privileges. however, he's been super helpful and patient to our questions earlier. thinking about telling him to lay low since there's a rift and ppl aren't liking him too much",

MEE6#4876,17-Jun-18 07:35 PM,"GG @suyashr99#7560, you just advanced to level 8!",
waffle.dynasty#2740,17-Jun-18 07:35 PM,He was chill until like a week ago,
waffle.dynasty#2740,17-Jun-18 07:35 PM,Very helpful too,
suyashr99#7560,17-Jun-18 07:36 PM,I've already told him to take a break yesterday but it didn't happen,
suyashr99#7560,17-Jun-18 07:36 PM,"Outcasting him will only making worse, like the roasting",
thedragonlegacy#2854,17-Jun-18 07:36 PM,^^^ my thoughts,
thedragonlegacy#2854,17-Jun-18 07:37 PM,i appreciate that he apologized,
waffle.dynasty#2740,17-Jun-18 07:38 PM,I've been sending him DMs with Tech specific questions in the last few weeks so that he can still help out among all the roasts,
waffle.dynasty#2740,17-Jun-18 07:38 PM,And I also have lots of questions lol,
thedragonlegacy#2854,17-Jun-18 07:39 PM,hmm i feel like i need to make an announcement about him or something,
thedragonlegacy#2854,17-Jun-18 07:39 PM,like a,
thedragonlegacy#2854,17-Jun-18 07:41 PM,addressing the elephant in the room message,
thedragonlegacy#2854,17-Jun-18 07:41 PM,"> yo, he dun goofed but he did apologize",
thedragonlegacy#2854,17-Jun-18 07:42 PM,> don't forget that he's been super helpful and patient towards our questions ever since the beginning,
thedragonlegacy#2854,17-Jun-18 07:43 PM,and uhh,
suyashr99#7560,17-Jun-18 07:43 PM,Need help?,

thedragonlegacy#2854,17-Jun-18 07:45 PM,~~(after i talk to him and confirm)~~,
suyashr99#7560,17-Jun-18 07:45 PM,">roasting him doesn't fix the problem, it only aggravates, ignore him if you don't like what he's saying",
suyashr99#7560,17-Jun-18 07:45 PM,>if he's being creepy contact an admin,
suyashr99#7560,17-Jun-18 07:45 PM,Something like that,
thedragonlegacy#2854,17-Jun-18 07:46 PM,ahh nice one,
thedragonlegacy#2854,17-Jun-18 07:48 PM,i'm actually going to DM him and kinda go over the above,
thedragonlegacy#2854,17-Jun-18 07:48 PM,other stuff i should bring up with him?,
suyashr99#7560,17-Jun-18 07:50 PM,Nothing really,
thedragonlegacy#2854,17-Jun-18 07:50 PM,"> take care of yourself fam, don't get too wrapped up with the freshies",
suyashr99#7560,17-Jun-18 07:50 PM,It's kinda hard to address the crap stuff,

thedragonlegacy#2854,17-Jun-18 07:51 PM,:/,
suyashr99#7560,17-Jun-18 07:51 PM,I can do that if you want,
waffle.dynasty#2740,17-Jun-18 07:52 PM,I would say it's creepy the way he hit on people. The 1 year age gap isn't creepy,
suyashr99#7560,17-Jun-18 07:52 PM,Yeah,
thedragonlegacy#2854,17-Jun-18 07:53 PM,"i dont think its hard to address.... ""bruh dont hit on girls in a chat that 800+ ppl are in""",

suyashr99#7560,17-Jun-18 07:53 PM,It's just it will end up with a sad explanation,
Samsung#6949,17-Jun-18 07:54 PM,Wait is he not in this discord?,
waffle.dynasty#2740,17-Jun-18 07:54 PM,Not that I know of,
suyashr99#7560,17-Jun-18 07:55 PM,>TFW I was Andrew all along,
thedragonlegacy#2854,17-Jun-18 07:55 PM,"honestly the whole thing is a representation of ""be careful of what you say online, it'll haunt you."" we already have a bad impression of him, and we haven't even attended a class at tech yet",
suyashr99#7560,17-Jun-18 07:56 PM,Yeah,
Gadget246#0848,17-Jun-18 07:56 PM,"wait isn't snowfish female, because moosh was playing with a dude.",
thedragonlegacy#2854,17-Jun-18 07:56 PM,she is,
KyotoKoto#5113,17-Jun-18 07:57 PM,snowfish is female,
waffle.dynasty#2740,17-Jun-18 07:57 PM,Nichole right?,
thedragonlegacy#2854,17-Jun-18 07:57 PM,"@Samsung#6949 he's been on discord before, but he's not active",
Gadget246#0848,17-Jun-18 07:57 PM,i've never been to sweet hut and i don't like the tapioca blobs in bubble tea but i like the tea part,
Samsung#6949,17-Jun-18 07:57 PM,oh aight,
suyashr99#7560,17-Jun-18 07:58 PM,A lot of places don't have good tapioca balls,
suyashr99#7560,17-Jun-18 07:58 PM,I only like the places that do,
Gadget246#0848,17-Jun-18 08:00 PM,"oh ok, i've probably just had bad ones so far then, cause i like tapioca pudding",
Gadget246#0848,17-Jun-18 08:01 PM,yeah nichole. idk someone said moosh was playing with snowfish but moosh was definitely not,
Gadget246#0848,17-Jun-18 08:01 PM,"i watched some of his stream, it was fun",
Samsung#6949,17-Jun-18 08:02 PM,I just looked at his stream and all I could think was that he looks like a dota player named ppd,
suyashr99#7560,17-Jun-18 08:12 PM,What dorms are y'all looking to go for,
Lennox#3038,17-Jun-18 08:14 PM,I'll be using this list for reference,
Lennox#3038,17-Jun-18 08:14 PM,https://www.society19.com/the-ultimate-ranking-of-freshman-dorms-at-georgia-tech/,
Lennox#3038,17-Jun-18 08:14 PM,idk how accurate it is,
suyashr99#7560,17-Jun-18 08:14 PM,But realistically based on your date of signing the contract what do you think you'll end up with,
suyashr99#7560,17-Jun-18 08:15 PM,I committed on like Day 2 after early was released and I've been told I could get Glenn and towers so that's what I was gonna try,
MKA#5877,17-Jun-18 08:15 PM,pick smith so you can have a *b o n d i n g* experience,
Lennox#3038,17-Jun-18 08:16 PM,My brother/roommate did his app a week after EA,
MKA#5877,17-Jun-18 08:16 PM,tbh that article seemed biased against west campus,
Lennox#3038,17-Jun-18 08:16 PM,which might be *just* out of glenn/towers,
suyashr99#7560,17-Jun-18 08:16 PM,Ay nice,
suyashr99#7560,17-Jun-18 08:16 PM,Twin?,
Lennox#3038,17-Jun-18 08:16 PM,ye,
suyashr99#7560,17-Jun-18 08:16 PM,Yeah it's pretty biased,
MKA#5877,17-Jun-18 08:16 PM,"""For those who don’t want to live in the midst of civilization, west campus is a great place!"" lmao",
suyashr99#7560,17-Jun-18 08:17 PM,Fitten and montag were renovated in like 2012/1,
bopas2#1774,17-Jun-18 08:17 PM,put smith before west campus lul,
suyashr99#7560,17-Jun-18 08:17 PM,Me and my roommate are pretty introverted so we considered West campus but I kinda wanted to make friends so I went east last minute,
suyashr99#7560,17-Jun-18 08:18 PM,@Lennox#3038 looks like we might be dormmates then,
joazlazer#2041,17-Jun-18 08:18 PM,west campus is bottom for some reason,
MKA#5877,17-Jun-18 08:18 PM,"smith > west campus totally,,,",
Lennox#3038,17-Jun-18 08:18 PM,"Hopefully, suyash",
suyashr99#7560,17-Jun-18 08:18 PM,"If you don't get Glenn , you could prolly get towers",
suyashr99#7560,17-Jun-18 08:18 PM,And Hopkins is right across the street,
Lennox#3038,17-Jun-18 08:18 PM,The first two faset's filling up after five minutes has dampened my confidence,
suyashr99#7560,17-Jun-18 08:18 PM,That's the order I'm going in,
Samsung#6949,17-Jun-18 08:20 PM,Yeah that seems to be the way to go,
Samsung#6949,17-Jun-18 08:21 PM,"Considering the west campus hate from that article, what are some of the pros of west?",
Xephoran#1160,17-Jun-18 08:21 PM,West campus is the one with bigger dorms in general I think,
bopas2#1774,17-Jun-18 08:21 PM,The gym is closer,
MKA#5877,17-Jun-18 08:21 PM,"quieter, closer to CRC, depending on where your classes are you could be closer to them, dorms are bigger",
bopas2#1774,17-Jun-18 08:21 PM,It’s away from the freeway,
suyashr99#7560,17-Jun-18 08:21 PM,It's prettier,
suyashr99#7560,17-Jun-18 08:21 PM,East campus is kinda ugly,
suyashr99#7560,17-Jun-18 08:21 PM,"West is nice, trees and shade",
suyashr99#7560,17-Jun-18 08:21 PM,Also,
MKA#5877,17-Jun-18 08:21 PM,yeah it's more open,
MKA#5877,17-Jun-18 08:22 PM,lmao,
suyashr99#7560,17-Jun-18 08:22 PM,sublime donuts!,
MKA#5877,17-Jun-18 08:22 PM,had to tone that down a little bit haha,
suyashr99#7560,17-Jun-18 08:22 PM,Rip,
bopas2#1774,17-Jun-18 08:22 PM,I don’t plan on going to the stadium or rushing so I don’t mind going west.,
suyashr99#7560,17-Jun-18 08:22 PM,I really don't like donuts but sublime is great,
waffle.dynasty#2740,17-Jun-18 08:23 PM,That website is wrong on so many levels,
bopas2#1774,17-Jun-18 08:23 PM,Agreed,
waffle.dynasty#2740,17-Jun-18 08:23 PM,Its just some chicks opinion,
bopas2#1774,17-Jun-18 08:23 PM,I’m just kinda sad that the 1st year population is divided like this,
suyashr99#7560,17-Jun-18 08:23 PM,No frat boys on West either 😉,
MKA#5877,17-Jun-18 08:23 PM,"yeah cons to west are farther from sports stadiums, farther from frats/sororities, uhh less ""activity"" i guess bc of that, some people hate west village with a passion",
MKA#5877,17-Jun-18 08:24 PM,i'm living on west so 🤷,
waffle.dynasty#2740,17-Jun-18 08:24 PM,@bopas2#1774 I totally agree freshman should all be close,

bopas2#1774,17-Jun-18 08:27 PM,"i'm happy with going west, only downside (for me) is that so many people I want to get to know are dead set on going east",
Samsung#6949,17-Jun-18 08:28 PM,I'm interested in Glenn/Towers just cause it seems like the nicer dorms and most of my classes (I dont think) would be that far from either side of campus,
thedragonlegacy#2854,17-Jun-18 08:28 PM,nobo is albert?,
thedragonlegacy#2854,17-Jun-18 08:28 PM,"oh does it even matter now, he graduated",
Xephoran#1160,17-Jun-18 08:29 PM,"West seems pretty good to me too, but the gatech subreddit has me worried about the food on that side...",
suyashr99#7560,17-Jun-18 08:29 PM,@Samsung#6949 same,
waffle.dynasty#2740,17-Jun-18 08:29 PM,Lol I want east because the building architecture is more attractive imo,
Samsung#6949,17-Jun-18 08:29 PM,Like if I cant get Glenn Towers I'll prob go for Fitten or Freeman or smth,
suyashr99#7560,17-Jun-18 08:30 PM,"I'm going Glenn, towers, Hopkins, then prob fitten",
suyashr99#7560,17-Jun-18 08:30 PM,I'ma cry if I can't get Glenn and towers even though I committed like day 2,
waffle.dynasty#2740,17-Jun-18 08:31 PM,You'll probably get them,
MEE6#4876,17-Jun-18 08:31 PM,"GG @waffle.dynasty#2740, you just advanced to level 11!",
waffle.dynasty#2740,17-Jun-18 08:31 PM,They house like 600 people I thought,
waffle.dynasty#2740,17-Jun-18 08:31 PM,Maybe not that many but still,
Samsung#6949,17-Jun-18 08:31 PM,I got in RD and I think committed like 5 days after :PepeHands:,
Xephoran#1160,17-Jun-18 08:31 PM,based off some rough counting i did earlier Glenn has about 128 single rooms,
waffle.dynasty#2740,17-Jun-18 08:32 PM,It's not like 30% of the incoming freshman committed week 1,
suyashr99#7560,17-Jun-18 08:32 PM,Well fuck,
MKA#5877,17-Jun-18 08:32 PM,so glad i'm in an LLC because I don't have to worry about time tickets lol I committed like early April since tech wasn't my first choice,
waffle.dynasty#2740,17-Jun-18 08:32 PM,Sorry I mistyped,
bopas2#1774,17-Jun-18 08:32 PM,"ok, I was super spooked",
suyashr99#7560,17-Jun-18 08:33 PM,Oh phew,
waffle.dynasty#2740,17-Jun-18 08:33 PM,I bet 50% or more committed in April,
suyashr99#7560,17-Jun-18 08:33 PM,Definitely,
suyashr99#7560,17-Jun-18 08:33 PM,Are Glenn towers freshman only tho?,
waffle.dynasty#2740,17-Jun-18 08:33 PM,Yeah,

waffle.dynasty#2740,17-Jun-18 08:34 PM,I think all FE dorms are freshman only,
Xephoran#1160,17-Jun-18 08:35 PM,Are Glenn/Towers even that much better than Fitten or the other two like that on West?,
Chafos#1781,17-Jun-18 08:35 PM,@MKA#5877 what llc,

Xephoran#1160,17-Jun-18 08:36 PM,They're definitely different sizes,
Samsung#6949,17-Jun-18 08:36 PM,West campus is usually a bit bigger,
pnw#8833,17-Jun-18 08:36 PM,wait really,
pnw#8833,17-Jun-18 08:36 PM,my tourguide lied,
suyashr99#7560,17-Jun-18 08:36 PM,Glenn and towers has much nicer lounges and bathrooms by the looks of it,
suyashr99#7560,17-Jun-18 08:36 PM,Like way nicer looking,

Chafos#1781,17-Jun-18 08:42 PM,I didn’t pay much attention to the different dorms bc of the llc but I heard Glenn and towers are good ones,
bopas2#1774,17-Jun-18 08:42 PM,Meh,
bopas2#1774,17-Jun-18 08:42 PM,I only use my Alexa for music and the dot’s speaker sucks,
suyashr99#7560,17-Jun-18 08:42 PM,@waffle.dynasty#2740 I'm not picking up a wire tap,
waffle.dynasty#2740,17-Jun-18 08:43 PM,Haha,
MKA#5877,17-Jun-18 08:43 PM,the only thing with glenn/towers is that everyone is there bc its nice and i heard the community there is worse but thats what i heard from other ppl so idk,
Chafos#1781,17-Jun-18 08:43 PM,I’ve heard that too,
bopas2#1774,17-Jun-18 08:43 PM,"again, as nobo said, it’s what you make of it. (IMO)",
Chafos#1781,17-Jun-18 08:43 PM,but the community feel probably varies dramatically,
thedragonlegacy#2854,17-Jun-18 08:43 PM,well let's make a discord floor and we'll have an awesome community,
suyashr99#7560,17-Jun-18 08:43 PM,Us discord folk will make it a good community,
Samsung#6949,17-Jun-18 08:43 PM,I feel like when everyone goes towards one place there's always going to be more assholes just cause there's more people 🤷,
thedragonlegacy#2854,17-Jun-18 08:43 PM,":,< it probs wont happen but an awesome prospect",
Chafos#1781,17-Jun-18 08:44 PM,isn’t smith the bad dorm,
Xephoran#1160,17-Jun-18 08:44 PM,decent ac > better community,
Samsung#6949,17-Jun-18 08:45 PM,^^^,
Samsung#6949,17-Jun-18 08:45 PM,I'm from PA I can't handle GA heat without a good ac,
suyashr99#7560,17-Jun-18 08:45 PM,@thedragonlegacy#2854 even if we don't we could still get Hopkins which is right across,
waffle.dynasty#2740,17-Jun-18 08:45 PM,The discord crew needs to hang out together. Dorms are boring though,
suyashr99#7560,17-Jun-18 08:45 PM,Georgia heat isn't a thing until summer tho,
Samsung#6949,17-Jun-18 08:45 PM,For me Georgia heat is any heat,
Chafos#1781,17-Jun-18 08:45 PM,are Glenn and towers both on east campus,
suyashr99#7560,17-Jun-18 08:45 PM,Like it's pretty cold during fall/ winter,

thedragonlegacy#2854,17-Jun-18 08:46 PM,@waffle.dynasty#2740  i'll probably arrange a meetup on move-in weekend,
Samsung#6949,17-Jun-18 08:46 PM,We could go clubbing :haHAA:,
Chafos#1781,17-Jun-18 08:46 PM,I love Mario kart,

suyashr99#7560,17-Jun-18 08:47 PM,@Samsung#6949 I love clubbing seals,
Samsung#6949,17-Jun-18 08:47 PM,How many people can fit in one dorm room lol,
suyashr99#7560,17-Jun-18 08:47 PM,But I didn't know Atlanta had a thriving seal population,
suyashr99#7560,17-Jun-18 08:47 PM,Switch is mobile,
Samsung#6949,17-Jun-18 08:47 PM,It's hidden,
suyashr99#7560,17-Jun-18 08:47 PM,Lounge bois,
Samsung#6949,17-Jun-18 08:47 PM,Gotta know the secrets,
Samsung#6949,17-Jun-18 08:47 PM,My one friend that used to live in Atlanta recommended some spas for me,
Samsung#6949,17-Jun-18 08:47 PM,So that's an option lol,
suyashr99#7560,17-Jun-18 08:48 PM,I'd say sublime tbh,
suyashr99#7560,17-Jun-18 08:48 PM,Donuts are pretty neutral,
suyashr99#7560,17-Jun-18 08:48 PM,And there's a paper museum across the street,
suyashr99#7560,17-Jun-18 08:48 PM,(Museum is an exaggeration),
KyotoKoto#5113,17-Jun-18 08:49 PM,we can have a LAN party lol,
Chafos#1781,17-Jun-18 08:49 PM,yo @suyashr99#7560 this may not be a bad time to drop that pic in the groupme,
suyashr99#7560,17-Jun-18 08:50 PM,It'll be sus if I do it,
suyashr99#7560,17-Jun-18 08:50 PM,Do you want the clout,

suyashr99#7560,17-Jun-18 08:54 PM,Hopefully the people who find it funny come soon.,
suyashr99#7560,17-Jun-18 08:55 PM,I got enough likes off Doggo pics,

waffle.dynasty#2740,17-Jun-18 09:03 PM,Both those girls just got active in the last few days iirc,
suyashr99#7560,17-Jun-18 09:03 PM,Yeah they did,
Chafos#1781,17-Jun-18 09:04 PM,I think at least one of them actually only just joined the groupme a couple days ago,
suyashr99#7560,17-Jun-18 09:04 PM,They both did,
Chafos#1781,17-Jun-18 09:06 PM,did we ever have any other interesting back and forth before the stuff that happened over the past few days in the groupme,
joazlazer#2041,17-Jun-18 09:06 PM,wait you're gonna be in west @Chafos#1781 ?,
suyashr99#7560,17-Jun-18 09:06 PM,There was the classic GT boys are ugly vs so are the girls argument once,

Chafos#1781,17-Jun-18 09:07 PM,I’m in folk because of the SMaRT llc,

suyashr99#7560,17-Jun-18 09:08 PM,That dude goes to my school,
suyashr99#7560,17-Jun-18 09:08 PM,The one that sent it,
Chafos#1781,17-Jun-18 09:08 PM,Who was it?,
suyashr99#7560,17-Jun-18 09:08 PM,The meme was masterminded by someone else,
suyashr99#7560,17-Jun-18 09:08 PM,Nicholas Giraldo,

KyotoKoto#5113,17-Jun-18 09:10 PM,okie then,
waffle.dynasty#2740,17-Jun-18 09:11 PM,I didn't get an error but they're making me get a useless vaccine,
Chafos#1781,17-Jun-18 09:12 PM,what vaccine?,
suyashr99#7560,17-Jun-18 09:13 PM,Probably the booster for meningococcal whatever,
MKA#5877,17-Jun-18 09:14 PM,"@KyotoKoto#5113 your file size is probably more than 4MB, I got an error like that and that was the problem",
waffle.dynasty#2740,17-Jun-18 09:14 PM,Nah it's the chicken pox vaccine,
suyashr99#7560,17-Jun-18 09:15 PM,Oh I got that at birth rip,
Chafos#1781,17-Jun-18 09:15 PM,yeah same,
Samsung#6949,17-Jun-18 09:15 PM,I mean the vaccine is still important,
MEE6#4876,17-Jun-18 09:15 PM,"GG @Samsung#6949, you just advanced to level 7!",
waffle.dynasty#2740,17-Jun-18 09:15 PM,There's a booster when you're like 5 or 6,
waffle.dynasty#2740,17-Jun-18 09:16 PM,You don't need the vaccine if you've already had chicken pox,
waffle.dynasty#2740,17-Jun-18 09:16 PM,I had it when I was 4,
Samsung#6949,17-Jun-18 09:16 PM,Oh I see,
suyashr99#7560,17-Jun-18 09:16 PM,Don't you have a possibly to get shingles if you had chicken pox,
waffle.dynasty#2740,17-Jun-18 09:16 PM,Yeah,
waffle.dynasty#2740,17-Jun-18 09:17 PM,But when I'm like 60,
suyashr99#7560,17-Jun-18 09:17 PM,Rip you at 60,
waffle.dynasty#2740,17-Jun-18 09:17 PM,But that vaccine doesn't help me with that,
waffle.dynasty#2740,17-Jun-18 09:18 PM,"It's literally a useless vaccine, but Tech won't accept ""disease history"" as a valid excuse",
waffle.dynasty#2740,17-Jun-18 09:18 PM,It's annoying but not that bad. It's not like the vaccine's gonna do anything negative,
Chafos#1781,17-Jun-18 09:19 PM,"if you or a loved one has been afflicted by chicken pox, you may be entitled to financial compensation",
waffle.dynasty#2740,17-Jun-18 09:21 PM,Lmao,
suyashr99#7560,17-Jun-18 09:21 PM,I wonder how an antivaxxer gets past this,
thedragonlegacy#2854,17-Jun-18 09:23 PM,k started discussing things w/ GM andrew,
thedragonlegacy#2854,17-Jun-18 09:23 PM,"wew it's going super well, i brought up all the stuff we discussed @suyashr99#7560",

suyashr99#7560,17-Jun-18 09:25 PM,@thedragonlegacy#2854 what's he saying,
MKA#5877,17-Jun-18 09:28 PM,"you're welcome, wish that tech had been more helpful in that sense it took me like three tries to realize that that was the problem lol",
thedragonlegacy#2854,17-Jun-18 09:28 PM,"i don't usually like posting screenies of private convos, cuz respect is a thing;;; but i feel like posting the start of our convo would help explain his side (~~screenie deleted~~)",
MKA#5877,17-Jun-18 09:29 PM,i think everyone means well and the group chat just spiraled out of control because there's so many people in there,
suyashr99#7560,17-Jun-18 09:29 PM,Yeah that's pretty much what I thought,
Chafos#1781,17-Jun-18 09:30 PM,was about to make a joke about something he said in that paragraph and caught myself haha,
Chafos#1781,17-Jun-18 09:30 PM,don’t want to stir this up further,
Chafos#1781,17-Jun-18 09:31 PM,he means well I think,
thedragonlegacy#2854,17-Jun-18 09:31 PM,:p thanks for recognizing that it's not exactly a meme-versation rn,
suyashr99#7560,17-Jun-18 09:31 PM,Also I don't think that Reddit account is his unless confirmed,

KyotoKoto#5113,17-Jun-18 09:33 PM,@Gadget246#0848 you didn't have to delete your message lol,
KyotoKoto#5113,17-Jun-18 09:33 PM,"maybe someone else would have found it helpful, imo, unless you really don't want it on record, just editing the message to say ""oops"" or just doing ~~this~~ would be better",
Gadget246#0848,17-Jun-18 09:34 PM,"okie, in that case, if your file is too big to upload for vaccines just print it to PDF with the microsoft print to PDF thing and it'll compress it",
Gadget246#0848,17-Jun-18 09:34 PM,how do you do strikethrough text?,
waffle.dynasty#2740,17-Jun-18 09:35 PM,Andrewison or whatever that reddit is is definitely him,
thedragonlegacy#2854,17-Jun-18 09:35 PM,i brought up the creep thing and got left on read,
thedragonlegacy#2854,17-Jun-18 09:35 PM,smh guys this moderating stuff is hard,

KyotoKoto#5113,17-Jun-18 09:36 PM,"@Gadget246#0848  you use 2 tildes on each side of the text, to strike through the text , , ~~[insert text]~ ~  (don't include a space)",

waffle.dynasty#2740,17-Jun-18 09:37 PM,Hes gotta be really disappointed rn,
Gadget246#0848,17-Jun-18 09:37 PM,you're really good at it tho marissa (from what i've seen),
suyashr99#7560,17-Jun-18 09:37 PM,Rip,
waffle.dynasty#2740,17-Jun-18 09:37 PM,^,
thedragonlegacy#2854,17-Jun-18 09:38 PM,"ah, makes sense, it's an embarassing topic and hard to face",
thedragonlegacy#2854,17-Jun-18 09:38 PM,~~deleted message~~,
thedragonlegacy#2854,17-Jun-18 09:39 PM,idk that's the last thing i said,
thedragonlegacy#2854,17-Jun-18 09:39 PM,"we'll see how it pans out, hope it's not too overbearing for him ¯\_(ツ)_/¯",
waffle.dynasty#2740,17-Jun-18 09:39 PM,Nothing wrong there. In fact that's very well worded,
suyashr99#7560,17-Jun-18 09:40 PM,He should be fine,
thedragonlegacy#2854,17-Jun-18 09:43 PM,"well, all that's left is to make a lil announcement on the main chat",
thedragonlegacy#2854,17-Jun-18 09:43 PM,what do you guys think about the recent roasting culture?,
thedragonlegacy#2854,17-Jun-18 09:44 PM,for those who have been lurking/active on there?,
suyashr99#7560,17-Jun-18 09:44 PM,It's pretty much bullying half the time,
suyashr99#7560,17-Jun-18 09:45 PM,Like he's right when he said he won't even say anything or just answer a question and just gets shit on,
waffle.dynasty#2740,17-Jun-18 09:45 PM,But some of the people who are roasted just take it as a joke and roast back (ie Katie and Mustafa),
suyashr99#7560,17-Jun-18 09:45 PM,But the other times he's just saying wild shit,
Chafos#1781,17-Jun-18 09:46 PM,yeah between Katie and mustafa it seems fine imo,
Chafos#1781,17-Jun-18 09:46 PM,"but they did all go hardcore on Andrew for a bit, even before he was sayin shit about poor people",
waffle.dynasty#2740,17-Jun-18 09:46 PM,Idk who else is involved tho,
waffle.dynasty#2740,17-Jun-18 09:46 PM,Andrew definitely has been treated wrongly,
suyashr99#7560,17-Jun-18 09:47 PM,Pierce kinda but he barely talks enough for it to matter,
suyashr99#7560,17-Jun-18 09:47 PM,But he's kind of the harshest,
Chafos#1781,17-Jun-18 09:47 PM,a couple others chime in now and again but it’s mainly those 3,
Chafos#1781,17-Jun-18 09:47 PM,mainly Andrew and Mustafa really,
waffle.dynasty#2740,17-Jun-18 09:47 PM,Among the incoming freshman I think everyone is fine?,
Chafos#1781,17-Jun-18 09:47 PM,yes I would say so,
waffle.dynasty#2740,17-Jun-18 09:47 PM,No one else being overly targeted,
suyashr99#7560,17-Jun-18 09:48 PM,There was that sumedh kid,
suyashr99#7560,17-Jun-18 09:48 PM,But he stopped talking,
waffle.dynasty#2740,17-Jun-18 09:48 PM,He's in Europe,
suyashr99#7560,17-Jun-18 09:49 PM,He was kinda messed with a bit a months ago,
Chafos#1781,17-Jun-18 09:49 PM,he used to talk a lot,
Chafos#1781,17-Jun-18 09:49 PM,I remember times when it was mainly him talking,
thedragonlegacy#2854,17-Jun-18 09:50 PM,"awesome, thanks for the feedback. Having multiple user input (i.e you guys) confirms that the stuff you say is true :p",
thedragonlegacy#2854,17-Jun-18 09:51 PM,"this is what andrew said about it: *""And like I said, I definitely get it, like a good roast is fun and I was laughing when they were roasting me at the beginning and it was great. But there was a line that was crossed and like it can’t be everything that people say because it got hurtful pretty fast even if that wasn’t the intention., , If someone (whether or not it’s that person) complains I think it should definitely stop, but before that it’s definitely kinda blurry since the chat should be fun and not strictly serious business but it also shouldn’t let things get out of hand""*",
thedragonlegacy#2854,17-Jun-18 09:51 PM,I had asked 'what should be done about the roast culture lately'?,

Samsung#6949,17-Jun-18 10:43 PM,Does that mean under 18 when I upload it or under 18 by the time I'm taking classes?,
Samsung#6949,17-Jun-18 10:43 PM,I'm 17 until August 7,
waffle.dynasty#2740,17-Jun-18 10:44 PM,With stuff like that it's based on when you sign the document,
waffle.dynasty#2740,17-Jun-18 10:44 PM,Since it's due before your birthday you need the under 18 part,

Snowfish#4289,18-Jun-18 12:09 AM,technically big but people are lazy a shit,
Snowfish#4289,18-Jun-18 12:09 AM,as*,
Snowfish#4289,18-Jun-18 12:09 AM,we probably have like 100+ members but its impossible to get them to come out excpet on the first meeting of every club,
Snowfish#4289,18-Jun-18 12:09 AM,usually get like 30-50 people on pizza days,
suyashr99#7560,18-Jun-18 12:09 AM,Of course,
Snowfish#4289,18-Jun-18 12:10 AM,of course,
suyashr99#7560,18-Jun-18 12:10 AM,I was thinking of doing a fun club like this along with like solar racing and some volunteering,
Snowfish#4289,18-Jun-18 12:10 AM,non-pizza days are basically meme days where everyone gets their inner stupidity out,

Snowfish#4289,18-Jun-18 12:18 AM,it just melted,
Snowfish#4289,18-Jun-18 12:18 AM,since for some reason someone thought it was a good idea to bring chocolates to an outdoor event in the middle of june,
udishab#2211,18-Jun-18 12:19 AM,isn't liquid chocolate basically just melted chocolate ice cream,
joazlazer#2041,18-Jun-18 12:19 AM,:Thonk_transparent:,
suyashr99#7560,18-Jun-18 12:20 AM,Is ice cream even considered a solid,

waffle.dynasty#2740,18-Jun-18 12:53 AM,What?,
waffle.dynasty#2740,18-Jun-18 12:53 AM,You couldn't get a student visa?,
Arya201#6452,18-Jun-18 01:09 AM,Nope,
Arya201#6452,18-Jun-18 01:09 AM,Now what?,
waffle.dynasty#2740,18-Jun-18 01:11 AM,Idk you should contact Tech about the situation,
waffle.dynasty#2740,18-Jun-18 01:11 AM,Is there a way to reapply for a visa?,
Arya201#6452,18-Jun-18 01:11 AM,Yes there is,
Arya201#6452,18-Jun-18 01:13 AM,But tech needs to help out too,
waffle.dynasty#2740,18-Jun-18 01:15 AM,I'm sure they'll be happy to help considering you're a committed student,
Arya201#6452,18-Jun-18 01:20 AM,They want me to show huge bank balance,
waffle.dynasty#2740,18-Jun-18 01:27 AM,Hmmm they probably need to know how you'll pay for tuition but I can't be certain,
efank#9753,18-Jun-18 01:39 AM,@Arya201#6452 do you mean your visa application got rejected?,
Arya201#6452,18-Jun-18 01:40 AM,Yeah,
efank#9753,18-Jun-18 01:41 AM,shit,
efank#9753,18-Jun-18 01:41 AM,worst case is starting a semester late,
efank#9753,18-Jun-18 01:41 AM,I remember they have a specific,
efank#9753,18-Jun-18 01:41 AM,set of instructions regarding that,
efank#9753,18-Jun-18 01:42 AM,so maybe there's solace in that they have outlined instructions (as in it's happened enough to write it),
Arya201#6452,18-Jun-18 01:44 AM,Main problem is GT didnt provide me a scholarship,
Arya201#6452,18-Jun-18 01:44 AM,Now the US government's concern is whether I can pay or not,
Arya201#6452,18-Jun-18 01:44 AM,And I can pay but how to prove that to them if they don't even ask for the bank statement,
efank#9753,18-Jun-18 01:45 AM,do they tell you why,
efank#9753,18-Jun-18 01:45 AM,it's the payment right,
Arya201#6452,18-Jun-18 01:45 AM,Nope,
Arya201#6452,18-Jun-18 01:45 AM,Yeah it's right,
efank#9753,18-Jun-18 01:45 AM,that's stupid,
Arya201#6452,18-Jun-18 01:45 AM,Everything's right,
Arya201#6452,18-Jun-18 01:46 AM,They didnt ask for any documents,
Arya201#6452,18-Jun-18 01:46 AM,Just i20 passport and some dumb questions and returned the passport,
efank#9753,18-Jun-18 01:47 AM,oh I didn't do it yet,
efank#9753,18-Jun-18 01:47 AM,I was told to bring documents though,
Arya201#6452,18-Jun-18 01:48 AM,Yes me too,
Arya201#6452,18-Jun-18 01:48 AM,Which country are u from,
Arya201#6452,18-Jun-18 01:55 AM,@efank#9753 what did u put for the phone number of the contact person in states?,

suyashr99#7560,18-Jun-18 05:47 PM,"Probably a couple thousand each semester, to be smart probably 1,500 at minimum?",
suyashr99#7560,18-Jun-18 05:47 PM,If you’re trying to draft a budget,
thedragonlegacy#2854,18-Jun-18 05:48 PM,... couple thousand? should be couple hundred per semester,
thedragonlegacy#2854,18-Jun-18 05:48 PM,"for eating out, club dues, and that jazz",

suyashr99#7560,18-Jun-18 05:53 PM,Probably not the smartest decision,
bopas2#1774,18-Jun-18 05:53 PM,what bank is good? Bank of America?,
suyashr99#7560,18-Jun-18 05:53 PM,There's a Wells Fargo near campus I think,

suyashr99#7560,18-Jun-18 05:56 PM,Bank of America is scummy too,

suyashr99#7560,18-Jun-18 05:58 PM,@Xephoran#1160 more than 2-4 miles might be too much,
KyotoKoto#5113,18-Jun-18 05:59 PM,"might also be worth it to see how far away your desired destination is from a MARTA station , , (there are 2 marta stations that are more or less on tech's campus), , **MARTA is GA's form of (shitty?) public transportation- there are buses and trains",
suyashr99#7560,18-Jun-18 05:59 PM,Walking across campus is like a 30 min walk (tech square to sublime),
Nobo#2748,18-Jun-18 05:59 PM,i mean,
Nobo#2748,18-Jun-18 06:00 PM,only if you walk really really slowly,
Xephoran#1160,18-Jun-18 06:00 PM,"turns out theres one right next to midtown station so, i figure that's close enough?",
Nobo#2748,18-Jun-18 06:00 PM,"also, my pro tip of the day is that several MARTA bus stops that take you directly to the station are next to Sublime anyways",
Nobo#2748,18-Jun-18 06:00 PM,or even better,
thedragonlegacy#2854,18-Jun-18 06:00 PM,"I have a google spreadsheet template specifically for college budgeting. If anyone is interested, I can hold a quick VC session to distribute budget template and 4-year course plan template , + discuss stuff about it",

KyotoKoto#5113,18-Jun-18 06:02 PM,could you use google voice to subvert the referral system?,
suyashr99#7560,18-Jun-18 06:02 PM,Probably,
Xephoran#1160,18-Jun-18 06:02 PM,is uber/lyft expensive? never used them before,
suyashr99#7560,18-Jun-18 06:03 PM,Yeah,
Nobo#2748,18-Jun-18 06:03 PM,well,
Nobo#2748,18-Jun-18 06:03 PM,with the fat amount of promotional discounts,
suyashr99#7560,18-Jun-18 06:03 PM,My house is about 8 miles from tech and an Uber from there can range from 20-100 bucks based on the time of day,
pnw#8833,18-Jun-18 06:04 PM,yo,
Nobo#2748,18-Jun-18 06:04 PM,and the fact that Lyft and Uber eventually figure out you're a college student and have promotional events,
Nobo#2748,18-Jun-18 06:04 PM,oof,
bopas2#1774,18-Jun-18 06:04 PM,do students get public transportation discounts?,

suyashr99#7560,18-Jun-18 06:05 PM,My fav thing about Marta is that my county has been sued for not expanding Marta to it,

thedragonlegacy#2854,18-Jun-18 09:37 PM,? no?,
bopas2#1774,18-Jun-18 09:37 PM,they have unfair policies towards Asians -- or something like that -- which make it harder for them to be admitted,
Gadget246#0848,18-Jun-18 09:37 PM,"for me it says a 30% decrease in enrollment this year, which is super suspect",
suyashr99#7560,18-Jun-18 09:38 PM,The admissions officers ranked Asian students Lower in personality scores even though interviewers did not,
suyashr99#7560,18-Jun-18 09:38 PM,"And used terms like ""boring"" and typical to describe asian applicants",
Gadget246#0848,18-Jun-18 09:38 PM,subjective personality scores which determine acceptance to a college :blobhyperthink:,

suyashr99#7560,18-Jun-18 09:39 PM,I'm fine with subjectivity as long as it's not subject to racial bias like this,
thedragonlegacy#2854,18-Jun-18 09:39 PM,";,>",
suyashr99#7560,18-Jun-18 09:40 PM,But basically it just confirmed what everyone already knew,
Gadget246#0848,18-Jun-18 09:40 PM,"idk, i think there's a difference between being holistic and allowing the admissions officers to choose who gets in based on their limited (and apparently biased) views of applicants, and subjective personality scores is crossing that line",

suyashr99#7560,18-Jun-18 09:41 PM,"@Gadget246#0848 to clarify, I meant by the interview",
bopas2#1774,18-Jun-18 09:42 PM,I just thought that site was super interesting because I could see the admission rate of my demographic in my major versus the overall school admission rates.,
Gadget246#0848,18-Jun-18 09:42 PM,um. your clarification confused me whereas your original message did not,
suyashr99#7560,18-Jun-18 09:42 PM,Let me clarify my clarification,
suyashr99#7560,18-Jun-18 09:42 PM,"Im fine with ""personality"" if it's by interview",
suyashr99#7560,18-Jun-18 09:43 PM,"And not by looking at what extracurriculars someone does and saying ""yup a robot""",
KyotoKoto#5113,18-Jun-18 09:44 PM,"as bad as it sounds, i'm fairly certain that schools (like GT) will receive more grant money the more... ""racially diverse"" their student body is",
bopas2#1774,18-Jun-18 09:44 PM,what is the legality of using race in admissions?,
bopas2#1774,18-Jun-18 09:45 PM,"i'm kinda ignorant in this subject, but is it ok for schools to judge base on race to create a balanced/diverse class or no?",
suyashr99#7560,18-Jun-18 09:45 PM,It's legal,
saxon_dr#3806,18-Jun-18 09:45 PM,yeah it is,
suyashr99#7560,18-Jun-18 09:45 PM,Some court case legalized it,
suyashr99#7560,18-Jun-18 09:45 PM,But it just can't be the only criteria,
saxon_dr#3806,18-Jun-18 09:46 PM,and unlike most people i don't think that's a problem tbh,
KyotoKoto#5113,18-Jun-18 09:46 PM,"since affirmative action is legal, i'd say that using race as _a_ factor is legal",
suyashr99#7560,18-Jun-18 09:46 PM,I don't think affirmative action is completely bad,
suyashr99#7560,18-Jun-18 09:46 PM,Needs tweaking and colleges need to be more transparent,
Gadget246#0848,18-Jun-18 09:47 PM,"oh ok, yeah that's totally cool with me, having part of the interview feedback be ""this person seems confident and polite"" or ""this person seems like they are pessimistic and blame others for their problems"" sounds reasonable to me, but looking at their application and then saying they're boring because you weren't feeling a connection with the piece of paper in your hands is definitely a thonking",
suyashr99#7560,18-Jun-18 09:47 PM,Ye,
bopas2#1774,18-Jun-18 09:47 PM,so the problem is that Asians are being held to a different standard?,
suyashr99#7560,18-Jun-18 09:47 PM,Basically,
suyashr99#7560,18-Jun-18 09:47 PM,Asians are competing for the same spots,
KyotoKoto#5113,18-Jun-18 09:48 PM,"hm, have any of you guys submitted a FOIA request to see what the admissions officers said about you?, , i considered doing it, out of curiosity, but i was too lazy lol",
saxon_dr#3806,18-Jun-18 09:48 PM,"first of all i think students actually do care about racial diversity (especially if there's nothing there at all), and secondly i think the minorities get enough passive (and sometimes just very proactive) disadvantages that a push in admissions is pretty fair",
bopas2#1774,18-Jun-18 09:48 PM,how does one do a FOIA request?,
Gadget246#0848,18-Jun-18 09:48 PM,"using race as a factor to admit someone is legal, using race as a factor to *not* admit a racial group is illegal, , it's a weird grey area",
suyashr99#7560,18-Jun-18 09:48 PM,I think another issue is that Asians are considered a model minority,
suyashr99#7560,18-Jun-18 09:48 PM,So in a sense they're stuck in a limbo,
bopas2#1774,18-Jun-18 09:49 PM,"ok ty for the clarification Schuler, that was what was tripping me up",
suyashr99#7560,18-Jun-18 09:49 PM,It's only legal if race is one of many factors also,
suyashr99#7560,18-Jun-18 09:49 PM,It can't be the only factor,
bopas2#1774,18-Jun-18 09:49 PM,hmm,
thedragonlegacy#2854,18-Jun-18 09:50 PM,i was talking with my friend and discussed something similar,
thedragonlegacy#2854,18-Jun-18 09:50 PM,and she brought up a good point,
Gadget246#0848,18-Jun-18 09:51 PM,"so if a college were theoretically questioned about a decision to admit someone of a minority they could theoretically include that person's race in their defense, but if data about admission practices reveal that a certain race was disproportionately disadvantaged then there's a lawsuit in the making",
thedragonlegacy#2854,18-Jun-18 09:51 PM,"at ivy leagues, you have many students applying to fill ""x"" amount of spots. Even with affirmative action and having certain amounts of ""seat open for certain races"", you are still competing with a multitude of amazing students in your race.",
saxon_dr#3806,18-Jun-18 09:51 PM,"and i think there are kinda conflicting forces at work, in the sense that at one hand the majority (in the case of tech schools are probably caucasian and asian people) are held to slightly higher standards, but on the other hands since there are less spots open for minority that brings up the competition too, so in the end the gap between the people admitted are less than the average gap",
saxon_dr#3806,18-Jun-18 09:52 PM,idk how true this is for undergrad admissions but from what i know at the higher levels of academia for the same position the minority are often more qualified than their majority counterparts,
Gadget246#0848,18-Jun-18 09:52 PM,"and also students definitely benefit from racial diversity even if they don't care about it, and some students definitely do care about it, i didn't even bother applying to UGA in large part because the engineering program there wasn't as diverse as i was looking for",
saxon_dr#3806,18-Jun-18 09:53 PM,yeah there were some schools like UIUC that were supposedly pretty good too but i didn't even bother applying cuz i know they're like all asian,
suyashr99#7560,18-Jun-18 09:54 PM,I only knew like 5 colleges when I was applying,
saxon_dr#3806,18-Jun-18 09:54 PM,"and the environment there is really bad, my friend told me that all the international asians hang out together, asian americans hang out together, and so on",
suyashr99#7560,18-Jun-18 09:54 PM,Finding more to apply to was a struggle,
thedragonlegacy#2854,18-Jun-18 09:54 PM,i have problem with a lack of emphasis on the *diversity of thoughts*.,
saxon_dr#3806,18-Jun-18 09:54 PM,lol,
suyashr99#7560,18-Jun-18 09:54 PM,Wait,
thedragonlegacy#2854,18-Jun-18 09:54 PM,but i guess that depends on the type of college tbh,
suyashr99#7560,18-Jun-18 09:54 PM,The international student thing happens everywhere,
Gadget246#0848,18-Jun-18 09:55 PM,"the thing that most people forget that marissa and her friend sort of touched on but i'd like to elaborate on is that despite the fact that ideally admissions would be strictly who the better applicant is. There are so many good applicants, and humans are so bad at subjective evaluation, that there's a significant degree of randomness even when the admissions counselors are doing their best to be consistent",
saxon_dr#3806,18-Jun-18 09:55 PM,i guess it's not really the sheer number that bothered me but more that there is little to no interaction between different groups,
saxon_dr#3806,18-Jun-18 09:55 PM,yeah that's true,
suyashr99#7560,18-Jun-18 09:56 PM,My postdoc research mentor and his friend at the MSE school were mostly just other international students,
bopas2#1774,18-Jun-18 09:57 PM,"so, if Harvard was truly unbiased, there would be an Asian majority at Harvard?",
bopas2#1774,18-Jun-18 09:57 PM,"And, beyond AA, they can't do anything to balance their class, legally",
suyashr99#7560,18-Jun-18 09:57 PM,"By the numbers, it would probably be mostly white then Asian",
saxon_dr#3806,18-Jun-18 09:58 PM,well it's hard to say biased or not biased cuz you gotta consider what the criterias are,
Gadget246#0848,18-Jun-18 09:58 PM,"There's a really scary statistic that I have no idea how to find but that we talked about in my AP Lang class, If you draw up a graph with the dependent variable being 'what percentage of cases does a local judge rule guilty on' and the independent variable being ""how many hours has it been since this judge has eaten"" there is a strong positive correlation",
saxon_dr#3806,18-Jun-18 09:58 PM,if i don't consider a certain criteria necessary then i could say if they considered said criteria it's just bias,
Gadget246#0848,18-Jun-18 09:58 PM,"so if you didn't get admitted, it's just as likely the person reading your application needed a snack as anything else",

saxon_dr#3806,18-Jun-18 09:59 PM,"there is an alumnus of my school that now is a professor doing AI research, so i was sending some emails to him asking about college and AI stuff, and there is this email that he sent me that kinda talks about this whole bias thing, lemme find it real quick :lilySweat:",
saxon_dr#3806,18-Jun-18 10:00 PM,"```You're not expected to see this at this point of your life (it's impossible), but contrary to what the world seems to say, college does not determine the success of your life. College admission is inherently flawed. The reason is very clear: it's simply too early to assess the true quality of an applicant this early in life, and thus everyone who's reasonably qualified has equal potential for greatness. It would've been far better if admission is actually randomized for fairness (read Outliers), but the unfortunate reality is that it's a rigged game with all kinds of bias (based on your ethnicity, your family background, etc.). So try not to let this affect you too much, it's bad either way (makes you feel haughty or rejected). Worse, it's false. Life is a long run, and I've seen people who seem to soar at this period of life and plunge, and vice versa. , ```",
waffle.dynasty#2740,18-Jun-18 10:02 PM,"What do you guys think about your high schools influence on college admissions? My friends tended to blame their rejections on the fact that our high school is only 10 years old and hasn't had time to ""prove its worth""",

KyotoKoto#5113,18-Jun-18 10:15 PM,@Snowfish#4289 ayy guessed right in the gossip grills chat,
Gadget246#0848,18-Jun-18 10:16 PM,Pro Tip from a Friend: You can see your AP scores a couple days sooner in your college portal than from the actual AP site if you sent them to GT,
Snowfish#4289,18-Jun-18 10:16 PM,^ THIS IS true,
Snowfish#4289,18-Jun-18 10:16 PM,ok caps lock,
brumeux#4293,18-Jun-18 10:16 PM,yeah schuler thats what i meant lol,
Gadget246#0848,18-Jun-18 10:16 PM,"oh ok lol, whoops",
bopas2#1774,18-Jun-18 10:16 PM,do i want to see my scores early?,
bopas2#1774,18-Jun-18 10:16 PM,or ever?,
suyashr99#7560,18-Jun-18 10:16 PM,@Inko#4822 Its a small world after all,
brumeux#4293,18-Jun-18 10:17 PM,"you might not, last year i didnt think i would and then. they came out and immediately i checked",
mic#7575,18-Jun-18 10:17 PM,"about UIUC, my brother went so I really wanted to go too and I thought it'd be a cakewalk to get in, and I was so excited to find out what the result would be since it was gonna my first RD admission result, but then I got waitlisted",
suyashr99#7560,18-Jun-18 10:17 PM,Yeah everyone was fuckin crying at out farewell,
suyashr99#7560,18-Jun-18 10:18 PM,Although a 1/4 of are going to tech,
mic#7575,18-Jun-18 10:19 PM,no I was OOS,
mic#7575,18-Jun-18 10:19 PM,I live in New York,
suyashr99#7560,18-Jun-18 10:20 PM,College admissions are weird like how do people get accepted to Stanford but then get denied to GT,
Snowfish#4289,18-Jun-18 10:20 PM,dude got a full ride to MIT at my school and denied from GT,
Snowfish#4289,18-Jun-18 10:20 PM,:haHAA:,
joazlazer#2041,18-Jun-18 10:20 PM,y i e l d p r o t e c t e d,
waffle.dynasty#2740,18-Jun-18 10:20 PM,Obviously GT is better than MIT then,

Snowfish#4289,18-Jun-18 10:21 PM,lots of elitists in the newer classes,
Snowfish#4289,18-Jun-18 10:21 PM,its pretty bad,
joazlazer#2041,18-Jun-18 10:21 PM,elitists :moon2PLSNO:,
bopas2#1774,18-Jun-18 10:21 PM,not in my discord chat!,
suyashr99#7560,18-Jun-18 10:21 PM,Probably bad for the school but good for you guys who graduated/soon to,
suyashr99#7560,18-Jun-18 10:21 PM,Your degrees become higher valued,
Gadget246#0848,18-Jun-18 10:21 PM,"because they worked harder on their stanford essays, because GT and stanford value different things in their applicants",
waffle.dynasty#2740,18-Jun-18 10:22 PM,I hope the number of elitist I meet is 0,
suyashr99#7560,18-Jun-18 10:22 PM,I meant learning environment,
suyashr99#7560,18-Jun-18 10:22 PM,Sorry,
Snowfish#4289,18-Jun-18 10:22 PM,im getting the fuck outta here in 1 more year BOIS :Pog:,
bopas2#1774,18-Jun-18 10:23 PM,"not before we steal your dog, you aren't",
suyashr99#7560,18-Jun-18 10:23 PM,"I'm only an anime elitist, forgive me",
Gadget246#0848,18-Jun-18 10:23 PM,because the stanford admissions officer had just taken their lunch break right before reading that person's app,
Snowfish#4289,18-Jun-18 10:23 PM,what is that small rainbow text,
suyashr99#7560,18-Jun-18 10:23 PM,Hype,
Snowfish#4289,18-Jun-18 10:23 PM,oh ur gonna have to get in line for cookie boi,
Gadget246#0848,18-Jun-18 10:23 PM,it's HYPE but rainbow,
waffle.dynasty#2740,18-Jun-18 10:23 PM,Lol @Gadget246#0848,
Snowfish#4289,18-Jun-18 10:23 PM,my brother has already tried and failed to steal her,
bopas2#1774,18-Jun-18 10:23 PM,we will succeed where others have failed,
Snowfish#4289,18-Jun-18 10:23 PM,good luck,
Gadget246#0848,18-Jun-18 10:23 PM,it would be funnier if it wasn't serious :haHAA:,
Snowfish#4289,18-Jun-18 10:24 PM,she legit cries if you try to take her somewhere without my dad,
bopas2#1774,18-Jun-18 10:24 PM,thats actually super adorable tho,
suyashr99#7560,18-Jun-18 10:24 PM,😦,
Snowfish#4289,18-Jun-18 10:24 PM,not when he gets out of the car for 3 minutes and she's acting like he's left her forever,
Gadget246#0848,18-Jun-18 10:25 PM,i'm glad you guys understand that :OOF: is a great word and should be utilized more frequently 👍,
Snowfish#4289,18-Jun-18 10:25 PM,wow,
Snowfish#4289,18-Jun-18 10:25 PM,i just realized that says oof,
Snowfish#4289,18-Jun-18 10:25 PM,not 100,
Snowfish#4289,18-Jun-18 10:25 PM,my world,
thedragonlegacy#2854,18-Jun-18 10:25 PM,...,

Snowfish#4289,18-Jun-18 10:25 PM,:OOF:,
Gadget246#0848,18-Jun-18 10:25 PM,it is probably my favorite one syllable word,
Snowfish#4289,18-Jun-18 10:25 PM,:PepeHands:,
brumeux#4293,18-Jun-18 10:25 PM,oof,
MEE6#4876,18-Jun-18 10:25 PM,"GG @brumeux#4293, you just advanced to level 10!",
Snowfish#4289,18-Jun-18 10:25 PM,"i was like ""100 isnt a word you idio--""",
Gadget246#0848,18-Jun-18 10:25 PM,that's a pretty large oof snowfish,
suyashr99#7560,18-Jun-18 10:26 PM,@Snowfish#4289 is GT psychiatry notoriously bad,
bopas2#1774,18-Jun-18 10:26 PM,nice,
brumeux#4293,18-Jun-18 10:26 PM,seeing the reacts tick up is similar to and better than slot machine gambling,
aquajet#7800,18-Jun-18 10:26 PM,oof is almost 100 mirrored,
bopas2#1774,18-Jun-18 10:26 PM,i'm still bitter that the picture of my dog got less likes than the other pictures 😐,
Snowfish#4289,18-Jun-18 10:27 PM,i mean,
Snowfish#4289,18-Jun-18 10:27 PM,yeah,
Snowfish#4289,18-Jun-18 10:27 PM,we have a lot of suicides,
KyotoKoto#5113,18-Jun-18 10:28 PM,aren't the legs on the chairs in the dorms (gt apartments?) slightly curved like a rocking chair to _try_ to prevent suicides,
Snowfish#4289,18-Jun-18 10:28 PM,also i made this emoji just for my reaction to the :OOF: 💯 stuff,
thedragonlegacy#2854,18-Jun-18 10:28 PM,i saw the memes,
Snowfish#4289,18-Jun-18 10:28 PM,:NotLikeThis:,
Snowfish#4289,18-Jun-18 10:28 PM,umm,
Snowfish#4289,18-Jun-18 10:28 PM,well they are curved but i dont think that's specifically for suicides,
bopas2#1774,18-Jun-18 10:28 PM,"fr tho, I'm sure y'all are fine, but if anyone wants/needs to talk about anything, you can hmu",
Snowfish#4289,18-Jun-18 10:28 PM,just cuz its comfy,
waffle.dynasty#2740,18-Jun-18 10:28 PM,I would think they'd be curved because rocking chairs are more comfortable but idk,
mic#7575,18-Jun-18 10:29 PM,I was thinking we could kidnap your dad along with your dog,
Snowfish#4289,18-Jun-18 10:29 PM,people kill themselves in more creative ways anyways,
bopas2#1774,18-Jun-18 10:29 PM,@mic#7575 me too lmao,
Snowfish#4289,18-Jun-18 10:29 PM,like jumping off buildings and suicide by police :haHAA:,
suyashr99#7560,18-Jun-18 10:29 PM,That last one was wild,
bopas2#1774,18-Jun-18 10:29 PM,yeah yikes,
suyashr99#7560,18-Jun-18 10:29 PM,I got the GTENS and alert and everything,
joazlazer#2041,18-Jun-18 10:29 PM,yikkkesss,
suyashr99#7560,18-Jun-18 10:29 PM,I remember seeing the video and all,
mic#7575,18-Jun-18 10:29 PM,how many suicides are there a year? jeez,
Snowfish#4289,18-Jun-18 10:29 PM,"i have to say, the riots afterwards were certainly an experience",
joazlazer#2041,18-Jun-18 10:30 PM,were they Berkley level?,
bopas2#1774,18-Jun-18 10:30 PM,people were protesting the police correct?,
Snowfish#4289,18-Jun-18 10:30 PM,lets light a police car on fire that'll change things :haHAA:,
suyashr99#7560,18-Jun-18 10:30 PM,Not Berkeley level,
suyashr99#7560,18-Jun-18 10:30 PM,But bad,
Snowfish#4289,18-Jun-18 10:30 PM,antifa was there,
Snowfish#4289,18-Jun-18 10:30 PM,"so i was like ""guess im ditching class today""",
suyashr99#7560,18-Jun-18 10:30 PM,Gtens alerts for a week straight,
Snowfish#4289,18-Jun-18 10:30 PM,"getting texts from family members all day like ""hey did you die""",
suyashr99#7560,18-Jun-18 10:31 PM,Lol I left campus an hour before the riot I think,
suyashr99#7560,18-Jun-18 10:31 PM,It was a wild day,
Snowfish#4289,18-Jun-18 10:32 PM,i sat at home in my underwear and played world of warcraft,
Snowfish#4289,18-Jun-18 10:32 PM,:EZ:,
bopas2#1774,18-Jun-18 10:32 PM,"my school got a shooter threat, students left, and my parents said ""stay at school, you're so skinny you won't get hit anyways"" :monkaMEGA:",
mic#7575,18-Jun-18 10:32 PM,Has the administration done anything since,
Snowfish#4289,18-Jun-18 10:32 PM,allegedly gave money to mental health,
Snowfish#4289,18-Jun-18 10:32 PM,"i think it was mostly like a ""please shut the fuck up"" kind of move, i havent seen anything actually change",
suyashr99#7560,18-Jun-18 10:32 PM,@mic#7575 also something about upping support for lgbtq students,
Snowfish#4289,18-Jun-18 10:33 PM,i can get all political on you guys but i won't,
suyashr99#7560,18-Jun-18 10:33 PM,But they're adding a social justice LLC next year,
Snowfish#4289,18-Jun-18 10:33 PM,oh yeah that too,
bopas2#1774,18-Jun-18 10:33 PM,oh boy,
Snowfish#4289,18-Jun-18 10:33 PM,forgot about that one,
Gadget246#0848,18-Jun-18 10:33 PM,this sounds pretty similar to my highschool unfortunately :FeelsBadMan:,
Gadget246#0848,18-Jun-18 10:33 PM,"right down to the ""doing something nominal so that people shut up without changing anything""",
Snowfish#4289,18-Jun-18 10:33 PM,i honestly don't think that social justice was the problem but hey who cares about my opinions,
Gadget246#0848,18-Jun-18 10:33 PM,^ not the people with the money,
bopas2#1774,18-Jun-18 10:34 PM,we care tho,
suyashr99#7560,18-Jun-18 10:34 PM,Bud 😔,
Snowfish#4289,18-Jun-18 10:34 PM,the social justice thing was 100% a move to get people to shut the fuck up rather than actually make any changes,
brumeux#4293,18-Jun-18 10:34 PM,god yeah seeing the video after the GTENS alert was so fucked up,
Gadget246#0848,18-Jun-18 10:34 PM,^^ us tho,
brumeux#4293,18-Jun-18 10:34 PM,but hey schuler no one in our year killed themselves,
brumeux#4293,18-Jun-18 10:34 PM,that i know of,
Snowfish#4289,18-Jun-18 10:34 PM,"though its kind of shitty because it somewhat implies that if it was a generic straight white male who got shot, there would be zero problems with it",
brumeux#4293,18-Jun-18 10:34 PM,so thats a win,
Snowfish#4289,18-Jun-18 10:34 PM,:haHAA:,
Gadget246#0848,18-Jun-18 10:35 PM,wait why was there a video with the GTENS thing?,
suyashr99#7560,18-Jun-18 10:35 PM,There wasn't,
suyashr99#7560,18-Jun-18 10:35 PM,Some Russian dude posted it to Reddit,
suyashr99#7560,18-Jun-18 10:35 PM,He recorded the whole situation,
Snowfish#4289,18-Jun-18 10:35 PM,there were like 50 of them,
brumeux#4293,18-Jun-18 10:35 PM,i mean everyone was freaking out and yeah. reddit,
suyashr99#7560,18-Jun-18 10:35 PM,The screams and all,
joazlazer#2041,18-Jun-18 10:35 PM,not safe for life jeez,
Snowfish#4289,18-Jun-18 10:36 PM,would not recommend looking it up if you're faint of heart yea,
suyashr99#7560,18-Jun-18 10:36 PM,Reddit activity on gatech becomes hyper inflated after gtens alerts,
Snowfish#4289,18-Jun-18 10:36 PM,yup,
Gadget246#0848,18-Jun-18 10:36 PM,"@brumeux#4293 I know, and that means that our school at least currently is 20 suicides in 21 years instead of being a 1:1 average, which is a sad accomplishment, but definitely better than the alternative",
brumeux#4293,18-Jun-18 10:36 PM,yeah considering there was no information whatsoever,
Snowfish#4289,18-Jun-18 10:36 PM,"""dont go outside"" _hmmm_",
brumeux#4293,18-Jun-18 10:36 PM,at least we're getting the rate down 😬  woo hoo,
Gadget246#0848,18-Jun-18 10:37 PM,"i think i'll pass on looking that one up, thanks for the warning",
suyashr99#7560,18-Jun-18 10:37 PM,It's not Gore or anything,
suyashr99#7560,18-Jun-18 10:37 PM,It's just the screams,
brumeux#4293,18-Jun-18 10:37 PM,oh yeah that was fun for nightmares,
Snowfish#4289,18-Jun-18 10:37 PM,"@Gadget246#0848 the tl;dr is someone had a knife, approached police with a weapon while yelling ""shoot me"", and gets shot",
suyashr99#7560,18-Jun-18 10:37 PM,I still remember them,
brumeux#4293,18-Jun-18 10:37 PM,cant believe someone would commit police assisted suicide like thats the most fucked up thing ever,
Gadget246#0848,18-Jun-18 10:38 PM,thank you for the tl;dr,
Snowfish#4289,18-Jun-18 10:38 PM,make a statement? who knows,
Snowfish#4289,18-Jun-18 10:38 PM,¯\_(ツ)_/¯,
brumeux#4293,18-Jun-18 10:38 PM,forcing someone to be a murderer. cool,
suyashr99#7560,18-Jun-18 10:38 PM,Iirc they called the cops on themselves,
Snowfish#4289,18-Jun-18 10:38 PM,its like jumping in front of a car,
Snowfish#4289,18-Jun-18 10:38 PM,it was already confirmed that they did call the police on themself,
bopas2#1774,18-Jun-18 10:38 PM,"agreed, but it's also kinda odd that he had to be shot, but I'm not completely informed",
Snowfish#4289,18-Jun-18 10:38 PM,well he approached police at short range with a weapon after being told to stand down multiple times,
brumeux#4293,18-Jun-18 10:38 PM,idk watching the video i kinda get it,
bopas2#1774,18-Jun-18 10:39 PM,tazer?,
Snowfish#4289,18-Jun-18 10:39 PM,"not really another option unfortunately, GTPD doesnt carry tazers iirc",
bopas2#1774,18-Jun-18 10:39 PM,gotcha,
suyashr99#7560,18-Jun-18 10:39 PM,It was the first time gtpd ever fired a shot,
suyashr99#7560,18-Jun-18 10:39 PM,In history,
Snowfish#4289,18-Jun-18 10:39 PM,its also not their training to fire tazer at that close of range if being approached by a weapon,
bopas2#1774,18-Jun-18 10:39 PM,what is the lgbt community like at tech?,
brumeux#4293,18-Jun-18 10:39 PM,iirc they called the cops on themselves and said there was a gun?,
brumeux#4293,18-Jun-18 10:39 PM,oh yeah i also wanna know,
Snowfish#4289,18-Jun-18 10:39 PM,"as someone who cant stand needless rioting, annoying tbh",
Snowfish#4289,18-Jun-18 10:40 PM,theyre a very vocal minority,
suyashr99#7560,18-Jun-18 10:40 PM,@bopas2#1774 p big I think since it's a pretty big gay city,
Snowfish#4289,18-Jun-18 10:40 PM,i can understand legitimate concerns but the majority of interaction ive had with them is pointless complaining and _lighting police cars on fire_,
joazlazer#2041,18-Jun-18 10:40 PM,riots :moon2PLSNO:,
joazlazer#2041,18-Jun-18 10:40 PM,lets burn stuff to enact social change :haHAA:,
Snowfish#4289,18-Jun-18 10:40 PM,that'll do it :haHAA:,
joazlazer#2041,18-Jun-18 10:40 PM,thatll show em,
mic#7575,18-Jun-18 10:40 PM,tazers are frickin painful according to the podcast 99% Invisible,
mic#7575,18-Jun-18 10:41 PM,although I would imagine getting shot is too,
Snowfish#4289,18-Jun-18 10:41 PM,"overall the community is pretty accpeting, considering the high liberal demographic, and the LGBT community is pretty large and integrated",
brumeux#4293,18-Jun-18 10:41 PM,does GTPD even have tazers?,
Snowfish#4289,18-Jun-18 10:41 PM,no,
suyashr99#7560,18-Jun-18 10:41 PM,:monkaMEGA: >TFW you wrote your GT essay on the positive response by the GT community to this event,
Snowfish#4289,18-Jun-18 10:41 PM,"but even if they did, they'd probably still shoot the person",
suyashr99#7560,18-Jun-18 10:41 PM,There was a movement to allow them to have some I think,
brumeux#4293,18-Jun-18 10:41 PM,oh my god,
Snowfish#4289,18-Jun-18 10:41 PM,guns are more effective than tazers,
suyashr99#7560,18-Jun-18 10:42 PM,But it got denied due to budget concerns before that,
Snowfish#4289,18-Jun-18 10:42 PM,it's the sad truth,
suyashr99#7560,18-Jun-18 10:42 PM,I think,
brumeux#4293,18-Jun-18 10:42 PM,weeell i guess admissions liked it,
suyashr99#7560,18-Jun-18 10:42 PM,I mean the response was actually pretty nice besides the riots,
joazlazer#2041,18-Jun-18 10:42 PM,or they ate a ham sandwich before reading your app,
joazlazer#2041,18-Jun-18 10:42 PM,:moon2SHRUG:,
brumeux#4293,18-Jun-18 10:42 PM,the GTPD positivity was really really nice iirc,
Snowfish#4289,18-Jun-18 10:42 PM,overall it was pretty good yeah,
brumeux#4293,18-Jun-18 10:42 PM,saw the chalk and stuff,
suyashr99#7560,18-Jun-18 10:43 PM,Like a nice calm vigil and mental health talk,
Snowfish#4289,18-Jun-18 10:43 PM,"i just wish they had been less ""LGBT RIGHTS"" and more ""HEY LETS NOT HAVE SUICIDAL PEOPLE :)""",
brumeux#4293,18-Jun-18 10:43 PM,yeah i hate how they made it about that when it was really. not,
Snowfish#4289,18-Jun-18 10:43 PM,doesnt matter what the person identifies as if they're depressed,
Snowfish#4289,18-Jun-18 10:43 PM,¯\_(ツ)_/¯,
bopas2#1774,18-Jun-18 10:43 PM,i think it should've been a bit of both,
bopas2#1774,18-Jun-18 10:43 PM,but idk,
Snowfish#4289,18-Jun-18 10:43 PM,i dunno,
Snowfish#4289,18-Jun-18 10:43 PM,just made me feel like there wouldnt be an outrage at all if some straight guy got shot instead,
Snowfish#4289,18-Jun-18 10:44 PM,which could be more damaging than well-meaning to mental health,
suyashr99#7560,18-Jun-18 10:44 PM,People made it sound like the cops were doing an affront to the rights of LGBT,
Snowfish#4289,18-Jun-18 10:44 PM,"""oh you don't matter _unless_..."" is always a bad wayto approach things",
Snowfish#4289,18-Jun-18 10:44 PM,my $0.02,
suyashr99#7560,18-Jun-18 10:44 PM,But imo unlike race you can't really tell if someone is LGBT by looks,
Snowfish#4289,18-Jun-18 10:44 PM,yeah that shit was stupid as hell,
Snowfish#4289,18-Jun-18 10:44 PM,i dont think anyone really believed that,
brumeux#4293,18-Jun-18 10:44 PM,idk how political we're allowed to get but. theres definitely an issues with police shootings and lgbt people (and poc) but lumping this specific event in doesnt make sense,
bopas2#1774,18-Jun-18 10:44 PM,could definitely argue that a lack of support because of their identity might have caused their mental problems. not to say that I don't support mental health care for all.,
MEE6#4876,18-Jun-18 10:44 PM,"GG @bopas2#1774, you just advanced to level 11!",
suyashr99#7560,18-Jun-18 10:45 PM,@brumeux#4293 I agree yeah,
Snowfish#4289,18-Jun-18 10:45 PM,i think general mental health was a better avenue to go down than LGBT rights,
suyashr99#7560,18-Jun-18 10:45 PM,It's kinda fucked up but the positive response to that event is kinda why GT was my top choice,
Snowfish#4289,18-Jun-18 10:45 PM,"if nothing else, it's a much better platform",
brumeux#4293,18-Jun-18 10:45 PM,i think thats why antifa came and why there were riots and idk. it made sense in the current climate but ultimately was based on something that wasnt actually a good example of the problem,
suyashr99#7560,18-Jun-18 10:46 PM,Coz ya boy got issues,
mic#7575,18-Jun-18 10:46 PM,"@bopas2#1774 huh, didn't think of that",
Snowfish#4289,18-Jun-18 10:47 PM,personally i really hate how GT's community reacts to things,
Snowfish#4289,18-Jun-18 10:47 PM,but thats probably because trump was elected in my first semester,
Snowfish#4289,18-Jun-18 10:47 PM,and nothing was worse than election day on campus,
suyashr99#7560,18-Jun-18 10:47 PM,That was probably like every college campus,
bopas2#1774,18-Jun-18 10:47 PM,"my school had therapy dogs after trump was elected, then later staged a walk out for an ongoing walkout",

Snowfish#4289,18-Jun-18 10:48 PM,no matter who won that's fucking stupid,
brumeux#4293,18-Jun-18 10:48 PM,a moment of silence????,

mic#7575,18-Jun-18 10:50 PM,it seems asymmetrical to be concerned about Trump's election makes people fearful when conservatives would probably feel the same way with a liberal candidate,

Lordbobby104#0879,19-Jun-18 12:58 PM,Thanks,
Snowfish#4289,19-Jun-18 01:24 PM,i actually like GT’s busses,
Snowfish#4289,19-Jun-18 01:24 PM,:PepeHands:,
suyashr99#7560,19-Jun-18 01:25 PM,Why,
suyashr99#7560,19-Jun-18 01:25 PM,Aren't they always late and inefficient,
Snowfish#4289,19-Jun-18 01:26 PM,i’ve never been fucked over by them tbh,
Snowfish#4289,19-Jun-18 01:26 PM,and they’re super convenient when it’s raining or really hot,
suyashr99#7560,19-Jun-18 01:27 PM,What Is the stingerette,
Snowfish#4289,19-Jun-18 01:27 PM,i think it’s a sort of late night taxi service,
Snowfish#4289,19-Jun-18 01:28 PM,so people don’t have to walk late at night,
Snowfish#4289,19-Jun-18 01:28 PM,never used it,
suyashr99#7560,19-Jun-18 01:28 PM,Wb the livesafe app,
Snowfish#4289,19-Jun-18 01:32 PM,what?,
suyashr99#7560,19-Jun-18 01:32 PM,They told us to download this app,
suyashr99#7560,19-Jun-18 01:32 PM,It like sends gtens alerts,
suyashr99#7560,19-Jun-18 01:32 PM,And you can get people to watch you walk,
suyashr99#7560,19-Jun-18 01:32 PM,Or alert them,
Snowfish#4289,19-Jun-18 01:33 PM,oh yeah,
Snowfish#4289,19-Jun-18 01:34 PM,i’ve used it like once,
Snowfish#4289,19-Jun-18 01:34 PM,i think it’s just a peace of mind thing,
Snowfish#4289,19-Jun-18 01:34 PM,i don’t do much night walking,
Nobo#2748,19-Jun-18 02:14 PM,"Stingerette is pretty useful in late-night cases, i.e. you were at midterm study groups at your friend's place, but it's 4AM and you're too tired to walk back across campus to your dorm on the opposite end",
suyashr99#7560,19-Jun-18 05:31 PM,@Snowfish#4289 there's a smash club?,
Snowfish#4289,19-Jun-18 05:31 PM,"yes there's a smash, smite, and LoL club",
suyashr99#7560,19-Jun-18 05:32 PM,Are they like melee only or,
Snowfish#4289,19-Jun-18 05:32 PM,"not really sure, the last LAN they played smash 4 and melee i believe",
suyashr99#7560,19-Jun-18 05:32 PM,Do you guys have smash for esports club?,
Snowfish#4289,19-Jun-18 05:33 PM,"not exactly, we usually give them rooms and prizing at events but we're hands-off otherwise",
suyashr99#7560,19-Jun-18 05:33 PM,:0,
Nobo#2748,19-Jun-18 06:45 PM,@suyashr99#7560 Smash group usually jams once a week once the semester gets going,
Nobo#2748,19-Jun-18 06:46 PM,They usually do Melee + whatever the latest,
Nobo#2748,19-Jun-18 06:46 PM,At large tournament/gamefest it's Melee/Project M/Whatever the latest,
joazlazer#2041,19-Jun-18 07:01 PM,so is gamefest happening this year?,
Lormen#5686,19-Jun-18 08:04 PM,What are your thoughts on Quora/reddit in regards to college information?,
MEE6#4876,19-Jun-18 08:04 PM,"GG @Lormen#5686, you just advanced to level 3!",
KyotoKoto#5113,19-Jun-18 08:05 PM,"can you be more specific on what you mean by ""college information""? , , like do you mean college life in general or information specific to tech or both, etc?",
Lormen#5686,19-Jun-18 08:09 PM,College life,
Lormen#5686,19-Jun-18 08:09 PM,Cause every time I go there I just get psyched out,
bopas2#1774,19-Jun-18 08:10 PM,for tech specifically?,
Lormen#5686,19-Jun-18 08:12 PM,"I go there occasionally just to see what people say about how to do well cause I want to make my first year go well, but I just get really psyched out at some of the stuff they say and it’s a lot to take in sometimes",
Lormen#5686,19-Jun-18 08:12 PM,Not specifically for tech,
bopas2#1774,19-Jun-18 08:13 PM,welp you need to be more specific lul,
bopas2#1774,19-Jun-18 08:13 PM,any examples?,
Lormen#5686,19-Jun-18 08:14 PM,"Just a lot of people that state what I already know: tech is hard and you will push yourself to new heights and limits and whatnot., maybe I’m just psyching myself up based too much on what other people say",
Lormen#5686,19-Jun-18 08:15 PM,It just gets to me sometimes,
waffle.dynasty#2740,19-Jun-18 08:16 PM,We'll be in the same boat as you this fall @Lormen#5686 you're not alone!,
Lormen#5686,19-Jun-18 08:17 PM,That’s good. Maybe I just need to stop reading so much on reddit and Quora and stick with my peers and my confidence,
KyotoKoto#5113,19-Jun-18 08:38 PM,"errr.. i don't you should just ""stop"" reading something like reddit, since it is an incredibly good resource (shilling/r/gatech once again). i'd just recommend that you take the advice you see with a grain of salt",
Lormen#5686,19-Jun-18 08:40 PM,"Well yeah, that’s a better way of putting it.",
Lormen#5686,19-Jun-18 08:40 PM,I’m more so talking about Quora than Reddit,
Lormen#5686,19-Jun-18 08:41 PM,Reddit has been really helpful,
Lormen#5686,19-Jun-18 08:41 PM,Quora just... has an air about it that I don’t like,
bopas2#1774,19-Jun-18 08:42 PM,"This is copied from reddit comments: ""Don't take most of the comments you see here on /r/gatech too seriously. This subreddit is a collection of some of the saltiest people on campus who will complain about literally anything. Campus culture isn't nearly as negative as you would be led to believe, so don't get scared away.""",
bopas2#1774,19-Jun-18 08:43 PM,"I think online forms harbor certain groups of people, just like discord does, and sometimes these people provide only a limited perspective on certain subjects.",
bopas2#1774,19-Jun-18 08:44 PM,"I agree with Kyoto, take posts with a grain of salt, and try to find diverse sources of information",
Lormen#5686,19-Jun-18 08:44 PM,This discord has been pretty good,
bopas2#1774,19-Jun-18 08:45 PM,I'm not saying the people on this discord are the same that are on reddit.,
bopas2#1774,19-Jun-18 08:46 PM,"I'm just saying that discord, generally, collects a certain group of people (nerds/gamers), which sometimes results in an echo chamber where everyone has the same opinion -- again, not necessarily true in this discord -- but may be true on the online fourms.",

Rye#0666,19-Jun-18 09:27 PM,@suyashr99#7560 Smash mmmm,
Rye#0666,19-Jun-18 09:27 PM,I played Smash 4 for a good while. Stopped last year after getting burned out but I'm definitely picking up Ultimate,
Rye#0666,19-Jun-18 09:27 PM,I might pick Smash 4 back up to warm up for Ultimate depending how active the scene is on campus,
suyashr99#7560,19-Jun-18 09:29 PM,Feel exactly the same,
suyashr99#7560,19-Jun-18 09:29 PM,I got burnt out by smash 4 at about the same time,
Rye#0666,19-Jun-18 09:29 PM,Are you going to play 4 on campus until Ultimate comes out?,
Rye#0666,19-Jun-18 09:29 PM,Or just wait,
suyashr99#7560,19-Jun-18 09:30 PM,Probably,
suyashr99#7560,19-Jun-18 09:30 PM,I'm not that good,
suyashr99#7560,19-Jun-18 09:30 PM,If there was a tier under semi pro,
suyashr99#7560,19-Jun-18 09:30 PM,I'm there,
Rye#0666,19-Jun-18 09:31 PM,I didn't attend local events much,
Rye#0666,19-Jun-18 09:31 PM,I was more active online,
Rye#0666,19-Jun-18 09:31 PM,Mainly on Discord,
Rye#0666,19-Jun-18 09:31 PM,I was active on Anther's Ladder for a bit too,
suyashr99#7560,19-Jun-18 09:31 PM,I did anthers for bit,
suyashr99#7560,19-Jun-18 09:31 PM,Watched tournaments,
suyashr99#7560,19-Jun-18 09:32 PM,I think the last tournament I watched was when anti beat zero,
suyashr99#7560,19-Jun-18 09:32 PM,Never really joined my local scene,
Rye#0666,19-Jun-18 09:33 PM,Are you from Georgia?,
Rye#0666,19-Jun-18 09:33 PM,Nvm role says so lol,
Rye#0666,19-Jun-18 09:33 PM,I attended a few Gwinnett Brawls,
Rye#0666,19-Jun-18 09:33 PM,That's about it,
suyashr99#7560,19-Jun-18 09:33 PM,Lol I looked into those,
suyashr99#7560,19-Jun-18 09:33 PM,By the time I could drive I didn't want to go,
Rye#0666,19-Jun-18 09:34 PM,I mainly just played friendlies with people on the character Discords,
Rye#0666,19-Jun-18 09:34 PM,Mained Falcon so I'm active in the Falcon Discord still lol,
Rye#0666,19-Jun-18 09:34 PM,It's funny because a lot of the people in there dropped the game,
Rye#0666,19-Jun-18 09:34 PM,Yeah same,
Rye#0666,19-Jun-18 09:35 PM,"Well when Ultimate drops, we should definitely get some games in. Would love to play some friendlies with you",
suyashr99#7560,19-Jun-18 09:35 PM,Same,
suyashr99#7560,19-Jun-18 09:35 PM,Lol I mained shiek don't hate me,
suyashr99#7560,19-Jun-18 09:36 PM,Strong luigi:/corrin secondary tho,
Rye#0666,19-Jun-18 09:37 PM,I mained Sheik at the beginning,
Rye#0666,19-Jun-18 09:37 PM,HAd more fun with Falcon though so I switched,
Rye#0666,19-Jun-18 09:37 PM,Had Meta Knight for a few matchups too,
suyashr99#7560,19-Jun-18 09:40 PM,Do you remember the hoohah days?,
Rye#0666,19-Jun-18 09:41 PM,Yes lol,
Rye#0666,19-Jun-18 09:41 PM,I secondaried Diddy with Sheik at the beginning of the game,
Rye#0666,19-Jun-18 09:41 PM,This was before hoo hah though,
Rye#0666,19-Jun-18 09:41 PM,Like really early in the game's lifespan,
suyashr99#7560,19-Jun-18 09:44 PM,I miss those afternoons I spent on for glory,
Rye#0666,19-Jun-18 09:48 PM,Hopefully with college I won't have to rely on online play too much,
suyashr99#7560,19-Jun-18 09:50 PM,Seems like a pretty active community,
Gadget246#0848,19-Jun-18 09:51 PM,"@Nobo#2748 why does that mean you've made a mistake?, i personally like gah-tech as a pronunciation (g as in gosh not as in george)",
Nobo#2748,19-Jun-18 10:35 PM,was memeing,
Nobo#2748,19-Jun-18 10:35 PM,most people say gah-tech anyways,

efank#9753,20-Jun-18 06:35 AM,glad i've been pronouncing it right ™,
Twinov#6441,20-Jun-18 08:14 AM,I've been saying gee tech didn't even cross my mind for gah,
suyashr99#7560,20-Jun-18 09:05 AM,Yo just had my wisdom teeth removed,
suyashr99#7560,20-Jun-18 09:05 AM,I feel weird,
udishab#2211,20-Jun-18 09:05 AM,how does it feel lol,
suyashr99#7560,20-Jun-18 09:08 AM,Weird,
udishab#2211,20-Jun-18 09:08 AM,smh i meant details,
suyashr99#7560,20-Jun-18 09:15 AM,It's all hazy,
suyashr99#7560,20-Jun-18 09:15 AM,Everythings swollen,
udishab#2211,20-Jun-18 09:21 AM,riprip,
udishab#2211,20-Jun-18 09:21 AM,1 like equals 1 prayer for you + wisdom teeth,
Snowfish#4289,20-Jun-18 11:40 AM,getting wisdom teeth removed is genuinely more inconvenient than painful @suyashr99#7560 i believe in u,
MKA#5877,20-Jun-18 11:46 AM,all the bleeding is really inconvenient and not being able to do anything for a while,
MEE6#4876,20-Jun-18 11:46 AM,"GG @MKA#5877, you just advanced to level 9!",
MKA#5877,20-Jun-18 11:46 AM,thanks mee6,
brumeux#4293,20-Jun-18 12:47 PM,do you get to keep the teeth,
MKA#5877,20-Jun-18 12:48 PM,no,
MKA#5877,20-Jun-18 12:49 PM,if they aren't straight up i think they cut them up anyway,
brumeux#4293,20-Jun-18 12:49 PM,😦,
brumeux#4293,20-Jun-18 12:50 PM,that sucks,
brumeux#4293,20-Jun-18 12:50 PM,mine are sideways but idk i wanted to keep them if only to show my mom,
MKA#5877,20-Jun-18 12:50 PM,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=brW4tsxxJEQ,
MKA#5877,20-Jun-18 12:50 PM,from this animation it looks like they cut it up into multiple pieces,
MKA#5877,20-Jun-18 12:50 PM,i didnt get the option to keep mine anyway,
brumeux#4293,20-Jun-18 12:52 PM,eghhhh do i wanna click on that?,
brumeux#4293,20-Jun-18 12:52 PM,too late i already am,
brumeux#4293,20-Jun-18 12:53 PM,ah cool gross,
MKA#5877,20-Jun-18 01:06 PM,the surgery itself was fine i was talking to the person about my shirt (I had gotten it when I was on vacation in the rocky mountains) and next thing I know I open my eyes and I'm in another room with gauze in my mouth,
KyotoKoto#5113,20-Jun-18 01:13 PM,did you have local anesthesia or did they just numb the area?,
MKA#5877,20-Jun-18 01:14 PM,i had an IV,
KyotoKoto#5113,20-Jun-18 01:14 PM,"when I get mine removed, I'm getting the former done because I have 0 desire to hear my teeth get cut up so I will gladly have them knock me out",
MKA#5877,20-Jun-18 01:15 PM,i got knocked out idk what kind of anesthesia but a few seconds after they turned it on i was out,
MKA#5877,20-Jun-18 01:15 PM,"like the only thing i ""felt"" during the ""surgery"" was them putting the IV into my arm",
MKA#5877,20-Jun-18 01:15 PM,and they opened up my mouth all the way that kinda hurt,
Snowfish#4289,20-Jun-18 01:25 PM,they gave me laughing gas before the IV so i didnt even feel that,
suyashr99#7560,20-Jun-18 01:36 PM,Lol I got the IV put in and mouth block,
suyashr99#7560,20-Jun-18 01:37 PM,And then all I remember is blue,
KyotoKoto#5113,20-Jun-18 02:23 PM,it's been about 2 weeks since my high school _apparently_ sent my final transcript to tech and tech still hasn't received it yet and this is kind of worrying me. how long does it usually take for tech to receive the transcript?,
Snowfish#4289,20-Jun-18 02:24 PM,i think a decently long time,
Snowfish#4289,20-Jun-18 02:24 PM,iirc,
Snowfish#4289,20-Jun-18 02:24 PM,might want to call your high school tho,
Rye#0666,20-Jun-18 02:25 PM,I sent mine digitally and it took about 6 days,
suyashr99#7560,20-Jun-18 04:11 PM,@Snowfish#4289 there's so much blood,
Snowfish#4289,20-Jun-18 04:11 PM,:monkaS:,
Snowfish#4289,20-Jun-18 04:11 PM,it'll go away,
Snowfish#4289,20-Jun-18 04:11 PM,just keep the gauze in your mouth,
Snowfish#4289,20-Jun-18 04:11 PM,it heals surpirisngly fast,
suyashr99#7560,20-Jun-18 04:11 PM,I'm also kinda scared because the ibuprofen has a reaction with my other medication,
joazlazer#2041,20-Jun-18 05:20 PM,:PepeHands:,
joazlazer#2041,20-Jun-18 05:20 PM,I just realized I'll have to get my wisdom teeth removed while I'm at tech,
Snowfish#4289,20-Jun-18 05:20 PM,get it during the summer,
Snowfish#4289,20-Jun-18 05:20 PM,its like 3 days of being out max,
suyashr99#7560,20-Jun-18 05:20 PM,Yeah that's why I did it now,
Snowfish#4289,20-Jun-18 05:20 PM,out as being out of it,
Snowfish#4289,20-Jun-18 05:20 PM,not in a coma,
suyashr99#7560,20-Jun-18 05:20 PM,All 4 at once,
Snowfish#4289,20-Jun-18 05:20 PM,hell yea 4 at once brothers,
joazlazer#2041,20-Jun-18 05:20 PM,im in classes rn nichole :PepeHands:,
suyashr99#7560,20-Jun-18 05:21 PM,Unless you take the strong ass painkillers,
suyashr99#7560,20-Jun-18 05:21 PM,Then you're basically in a coma,
Snowfish#4289,20-Jun-18 05:22 PM,yea i meant like next summer,
Snowfish#4289,20-Jun-18 05:22 PM,or spring break,
Snowfish#4289,20-Jun-18 05:22 PM,idk,
joazlazer#2041,20-Jun-18 05:22 PM,o yeah i guess,
Snowfish#4289,20-Jun-18 05:22 PM,they gave me vicodin and i was out like a light for an entire day,
suyashr99#7560,20-Jun-18 05:23 PM,I got prescribed Percocets,
suyashr99#7560,20-Jun-18 05:23 PM,Idk if I need to take them,
Snowfish#4289,20-Jun-18 05:23 PM,second day is the worst,
Snowfish#4289,20-Jun-18 05:23 PM,after that i just took ibuprofen,
suyashr99#7560,20-Jun-18 05:27 PM,:OOF: when everything tastes like blood,
KyotoKoto#5113,20-Jun-18 05:28 PM,our Neanderthal ancestors would be proud,

MKA#5877,20-Jun-18 06:05 PM,i only took ibuprofen after getting my wisdom teeth out i wasnt gonna risk getting addicted to shit,
MKA#5877,20-Jun-18 06:05 PM,i took like 800mg every few hours tho haha,
kk4jrq#5652,20-Jun-18 06:05 PM,^^^,
bopas2#1774,20-Jun-18 06:05 PM,They gave me some of the more legit painkillers and I was VERY out of it,
bopas2#1774,20-Jun-18 06:06 PM,I stopped taking those pretty quickly,
bopas2#1774,20-Jun-18 06:08 PM,did the anesthesia make anyone act crazy like in those videos you see?,
suyashr99#7560,20-Jun-18 06:08 PM,No I was just out of it,
suyashr99#7560,20-Jun-18 06:08 PM,And just more open,
MKA#5877,20-Jun-18 06:08 PM,when I woke up for the first time after surgery i just was a little tired,
MKA#5877,20-Jun-18 06:09 PM,other than that I had control over everything I did I wasn't goin crazy lol,
kk4jrq#5652,20-Jun-18 06:09 PM,I was just crying because I couldn't do math in my head cuz things were all scramble...,
suyashr99#7560,20-Jun-18 06:10 PM,Lol in the car ride back I tried doing math in my head to see how out of it I was and thankfully I still could,
kk4jrq#5652,20-Jun-18 06:10 PM,I was fine once I got in the car and was riding home... It was right when I woke up tho,
suyashr99#7560,20-Jun-18 06:11 PM,Oh I just remember the first thing I said when I woke up,
suyashr99#7560,20-Jun-18 06:11 PM,"It was like ""that felt like a blue carnival""",

waffle.dynasty#2740,20-Jun-18 08:59 PM,I'm gonna wake up tomorrow to 500 messages then,
bopas2#1774,20-Jun-18 09:00 PM,where the majority of the messages are questions that have already been asked and answered.,
Snowfish#4289,20-Jun-18 09:18 PM,groupme spice is pretty low,
suyashr99#7560,20-Jun-18 09:45 PM,"I like how everyone has gone from being ""OMG IM SO EXCITED TO GO TO TECH OMG omg "" to ""what the fuck get your shit together tech""",
8726andrew#5709,20-Jun-18 09:47 PM,i never quite understood people getting that super excited over a school lol,
bopas2#1774,20-Jun-18 09:47 PM,more like excited for the opportunities and friendship Gt will bring,
8726andrew#5709,20-Jun-18 09:47 PM,tech has fucked up a significant amount of things that it really just shouldn't have so im just jaded now,
bopas2#1774,20-Jun-18 09:48 PM,agreeeeed,
suyashr99#7560,20-Jun-18 09:48 PM,My expectations were already low,
8726andrew#5709,20-Jun-18 09:48 PM,shout outs to last semester where they told all of the distance kids that we couldn't take the math class we were enrolled in bc we didn't have the credits even though we all did,
suyashr99#7560,20-Jun-18 09:48 PM,I remember that,
suyashr99#7560,20-Jun-18 09:48 PM,And when they tried to get us signed up for duo,
suyashr99#7560,20-Jun-18 09:49 PM,A whole semester early,
waffle.dynasty#2740,20-Jun-18 09:49 PM,Am I the only one not mad at all about the housing thing,
bopas2#1774,20-Jun-18 09:50 PM,I just feel like there should’ve been better communication about everything. But ppl do need to relax IMO,
suyashr99#7560,20-Jun-18 09:50 PM,I'm more annoyed at how inefficient and stupid their system is,
8726andrew#5709,20-Jun-18 09:50 PM,i mean its bullshit pretty much because they've been unecessarily vague,
8726andrew#5709,20-Jun-18 09:51 PM,but like i've got more important things to do that brood over it all day lol,
suyashr99#7560,20-Jun-18 09:51 PM,"If I wasn't on anxiety meds, I'd be freaking out way more over this",
bopas2#1774,20-Jun-18 09:52 PM,"I feel like they’re playing themselves because by not being specific, they’ve earned themselves a pile of emails and phone calls",
suyashr99#7560,20-Jun-18 09:52 PM,Yeah which is why it's stupid lol,
waffle.dynasty#2740,20-Jun-18 09:52 PM,It's not like you're gonna select our of order,
waffle.dynasty#2740,20-Jun-18 09:53 PM,I guess I'm just used to not being told everything,
bopas2#1774,20-Jun-18 09:53 PM,"and you know as soon as the first time slot is out, everyone will log in and crash the servers despite being told not to",
8726andrew#5709,20-Jun-18 09:53 PM,hence why they ask you to be courteous and not do that,
8726andrew#5709,20-Jun-18 09:53 PM,even tho i doubt that does anything,
8726andrew#5709,20-Jun-18 09:54 PM,also like if you miss your timeslot someone else might take a room you want and could've gotten so i get the worrying and stuff,
suyashr99#7560,20-Jun-18 09:54 PM,I really hope nobody says when their timeslots are out,
8726andrew#5709,20-Jun-18 09:54 PM,we'll all get emails,
suyashr99#7560,20-Jun-18 09:54 PM,Yeah I just specifically hope not in that GroupMe,
Snowfish#4289,20-Jun-18 09:54 PM,i was actually very excited for college,
Snowfish#4289,20-Jun-18 09:54 PM,i couldn’t stop talking about it,
bopas2#1774,20-Jun-18 09:54 PM,Do I take my laptop to work or can I probably do it on my phone?,
Snowfish#4289,20-Jun-18 09:55 PM,then i realized it’s another institution and i’m just an undergrad so i don’t actually learn anything,
Snowfish#4289,20-Jun-18 09:55 PM,i just complete requirements for a piece of paper,
bopas2#1774,20-Jun-18 09:55 PM,are you going to grad school snowfish?,

Snowfish#4289,20-Jun-18 09:56 PM,probably going to do bioinformatics,
Snowfish#4289,20-Jun-18 09:56 PM,always been the thing that interested me the most,
Snowfish#4289,20-Jun-18 09:56 PM,"and it’s a combination of what i’m good at (cs) and what i’m really interested in (biology, specifically genetics)",
suyashr99#7560,20-Jun-18 09:57 PM,I didn't know people paid for grad school or PhD because all I've heard is people getting paid to do them,
Snowfish#4289,20-Jun-18 09:57 PM,they usually are paid to,
suyashr99#7560,20-Jun-18 09:57 PM,I really did not know two shita about college,
Snowfish#4289,20-Jun-18 09:57 PM,but it’s not guaranteed,

Snowfish#4289,20-Jun-18 10:00 PM,and i’m like hmmm ok,
Snowfish#4289,20-Jun-18 10:00 PM,"thinking hey, i barely know her but at least we’ll be able to socialize prior to moving in together so it’s like a pseudo-random roommate",
Snowfish#4289,20-Jun-18 10:00 PM,and we have a baseline of conversation,
Snowfish#4289,20-Jun-18 10:00 PM,seems reasonable,
Snowfish#4289,20-Jun-18 10:00 PM,now of course i’m not an idiot or anything so i establish all of the baseline rules of the room,
Snowfish#4289,20-Jun-18 10:00 PM,“i need my PC”,
Snowfish#4289,20-Jun-18 10:01 PM,“my PC has a loud mechanical keyboard”,

Snowfish#4289,20-Jun-18 10:01 PM,“i will have boys over sometimes but they won’t stay the night”,

Snowfish#4289,20-Jun-18 10:05 PM,so i’m sort of on the fence,

Snowfish#4289,20-Jun-18 10:07 PM,my official major was ChBE,
Snowfish#4289,20-Jun-18 10:07 PM,too lazy to switch,
Snowfish#4289,20-Jun-18 10:07 PM,so i take business law and accounting,
Snowfish#4289,20-Jun-18 10:07 PM,and uh,
Snowfish#4289,20-Jun-18 10:07 PM,"linear algebra, US history, and engl 1102",

Snowfish#4289,20-Jun-18 10:08 PM,"and i liked my professors kinda, classes seemed doable, roommate was chill about me playing dota until a reasonable hour of 10 PM when i would always close my computer and go to my laptop, life was good",
Snowfish#4289,20-Jun-18 10:08 PM,then my boyfriend from high school started coming over,
Snowfish#4289,20-Jun-18 10:08 PM,and i guess that set her off,

Snowfish#4289,20-Jun-18 10:09 PM,suddenly she didn’t even want to _see_ him,
Snowfish#4289,20-Jun-18 10:09 PM,suddenly my keyboard was too loud,
Snowfish#4289,20-Jun-18 10:09 PM,suddenly my computers fan was too loud 🤔,
Snowfish#4289,20-Jun-18 10:09 PM,so i say “i’ll just come over to your dorm in a different college then”,
Snowfish#4289,20-Jun-18 10:09 PM,and i send my PC back home,
Snowfish#4289,20-Jun-18 10:09 PM,"after all, i’m good to compromise",
MKA#5877,20-Jun-18 10:09 PM,wait where was the compromise there,

Snowfish#4289,20-Jun-18 10:12 PM,which is basically us and 2 other girls from another dorm go to lunch and try to meet each other,
Snowfish#4289,20-Jun-18 10:12 PM,not really a date,
Snowfish#4289,20-Jun-18 10:13 PM,"and i like them, i’m getting along with them",

suyashr99#7560,20-Jun-18 10:16 PM,Oh no,
Snowfish#4289,20-Jun-18 10:16 PM,“omg that smells SO GROSS”,
suyashr99#7560,20-Jun-18 10:16 PM,Not the popcorn,
Snowfish#4289,20-Jun-18 10:16 PM,and that’s the kind of person my roommate was.,
Snowfish#4289,20-Jun-18 10:16 PM,now back to the story,
Snowfish#4289,20-Jun-18 10:16 PM,she goes up to my boyfriend accusing him of making her depressed etc by “stealing me”,
Snowfish#4289,20-Jun-18 10:17 PM,do i kindly inform her that we are not married and i am not legally required to be her 24/7 friend,
mic#7575,20-Jun-18 10:17 PM,was she in love with you or something?,
Snowfish#4289,20-Jun-18 10:17 PM,i think so,
Snowfish#4289,20-Jun-18 10:17 PM,she said she was bi and i used to catch her trying to look at me while i was getting dressed,
Snowfish#4289,20-Jun-18 10:17 PM,but that’s beside the point,
waffle.dynasty#2740,20-Jun-18 10:17 PM,Ummm,
mic#7575,20-Jun-18 10:17 PM,jealous of your keyboard and computer fans too ehh,
Snowfish#4289,20-Jun-18 10:18 PM,so _anyways_,
Snowfish#4289,20-Jun-18 10:18 PM,i basically stop talking to her,
Snowfish#4289,20-Jun-18 10:18 PM,only hang out with boyfriend and dudes on his campus and then some boys from the esports club,
Snowfish#4289,20-Jun-18 10:18 PM,which thus pisses her off,
Snowfish#4289,20-Jun-18 10:18 PM,and she goes around the dorm calling me a slut etc,
unahb#8581,20-Jun-18 10:18 PM,hi,

thedragonlegacy#2854,20-Jun-18 10:20 PM,Joshua posted a list of dorms and it has data about renovation dates,
saxon_dr#3806,20-Jun-18 10:20 PM,damn at least the roommate i hates in high school was more mature than that,
MKA#5877,20-Jun-18 10:20 PM,was just about to say that lol,
saxon_dr#3806,20-Jun-18 10:20 PM,we just both agreee to ignore each other,
Snowfish#4289,20-Jun-18 10:20 PM,i have the next part of story typed up,
Snowfish#4289,20-Jun-18 10:21 PM,lemme know when to go,
suyashr99#7560,20-Jun-18 10:21 PM,Send,
MKA#5877,20-Jun-18 10:21 PM,👍,
8726andrew#5709,20-Jun-18 10:21 PM,go,
Snowfish#4289,20-Jun-18 10:21 PM,anyways so by that point in time she had basically soured her own reputation by talking shit about everyone behind their back so nobody really believed her (hence why they told me she was doing that shit) but it pissed me off pretty bad,
suyashr99#7560,20-Jun-18 10:21 PM,😈 *incoming epic roast*,
Snowfish#4289,20-Jun-18 10:21 PM,but simultaneously i had some pretty personal shit going down with some long time friends of mine and some really bad drama that i don’t want to get into so i was like “ok whatever”,
MKA#5877,20-Jun-18 10:21 PM,punch her in the face,
Snowfish#4289,20-Jun-18 10:22 PM,but i was honestly so livid at that point that i legit hated college and just wanted to get the fuck out as soon as humanly possible,
Snowfish#4289,20-Jun-18 10:22 PM,so i go super smart boye mode,
Snowfish#4289,20-Jun-18 10:22 PM,whip open my handy dandy excel sheet,
Snowfish#4289,20-Jun-18 10:22 PM,realize i can graduate college in 3 years with CS,
Snowfish#4289,20-Jun-18 10:22 PM,“ok i’ll do that”,
mic#7575,20-Jun-18 10:23 PM,the end?,
Snowfish#4289,20-Jun-18 10:23 PM,no,
Snowfish#4289,20-Jun-18 10:23 PM,sorry,
Snowfish#4289,20-Jun-18 10:23 PM,well yeah more or less,
Snowfish#4289,20-Jun-18 10:23 PM,there was a small moment of time when we got along again,
Snowfish#4289,20-Jun-18 10:24 PM,because i broke up with my boyfriend,
Snowfish#4289,20-Jun-18 10:24 PM,but then i got a new one so shit proceeded o hit the fan yet again,
Snowfish#4289,20-Jun-18 10:24 PM,but at that point i had had enough,
Snowfish#4289,20-Jun-18 10:24 PM,“bitch ruined my freshman year and made me hate college even though i was so excited”,
Snowfish#4289,20-Jun-18 10:24 PM,so i went full guerrilla warfare on her but,
Snowfish#4289,20-Jun-18 10:25 PM,that’s a story for another time,
Snowfish#4289,20-Jun-18 10:25 PM,it’s cuz you’re late boi,
MKA#5877,20-Jun-18 10:25 PM,this story been a whole ride damn,
8726andrew#5709,20-Jun-18 10:25 PM,sounds like a lot of fun,
thedragonlegacy#2854,20-Jun-18 10:25 PM,10/10 recommend,
Snowfish#4289,20-Jun-18 10:25 PM,yeah,
Snowfish#4289,20-Jun-18 10:25 PM,i kinda regret how absolutely douchey i got toward the end,
Snowfish#4289,20-Jun-18 10:26 PM,"setting alarms on her phone at 2, 4 AM before her finals, intentionally thinned the straps of her shoes if she left them on my side, etc",
Snowfish#4289,20-Jun-18 10:26 PM,i try to tell myself it was well deserved,
MKA#5877,20-Jun-18 10:26 PM,what i got out of this is dont room with people you knew in high school,
Snowfish#4289,20-Jun-18 10:27 PM,was honestly just cathartic past a point,
mic#7575,20-Jun-18 10:27 PM,oops,
Snowfish#4289,20-Jun-18 10:27 PM,don’t room with SATAN,
MKA#5877,20-Jun-18 10:27 PM,well that too,
Snowfish#4289,20-Jun-18 10:27 PM,i barely even knew her,
Snowfish#4289,20-Jun-18 10:27 PM,like i knew her name,
Snowfish#4289,20-Jun-18 10:27 PM,that was about it,
Samsung#6949,20-Jun-18 10:27 PM,Wait but I want to know how she was ok with you playing dota,
Samsung#6949,20-Jun-18 10:27 PM,Did you not scream,
Snowfish#4289,20-Jun-18 10:27 PM,she was not,
Snowfish#4289,20-Jun-18 10:27 PM,i had to play on other people’s computers,
Snowfish#4289,20-Jun-18 10:27 PM,for our league matches,
Snowfish#4289,20-Jun-18 10:27 PM,god bless,
Samsung#6949,20-Jun-18 10:27 PM,omg,
Snowfish#4289,20-Jun-18 10:28 PM,probably would’ve done pretty well if my internet didn’t spike to like 5000 ping during our last series :PepeHands:,
Snowfish#4289,20-Jun-18 10:28 PM,but yeah,
Snowfish#4289,20-Jun-18 10:28 PM,that’s my freshman year,
Snowfish#4289,20-Jun-18 10:28 PM,i legit almost dropped out a few times,
Snowfish#4289,20-Jun-18 10:29 PM,so don’t do that,
suyashr99#7560,20-Jun-18 10:29 PM,You seem semi normal now so I guess recovery is possible,
Snowfish#4289,20-Jun-18 10:29 PM,"get a decent roommate, compromise, and don’t be afraid to take a while to figure out what you want to do",
unahb#8581,20-Jun-18 10:29 PM,do you have this story typed up somewhere,
Snowfish#4289,20-Jun-18 10:29 PM,like i took 2 completely useless classes for my major and i’m still graduating early so,
Snowfish#4289,20-Jun-18 10:29 PM,no,
unahb#8581,20-Jun-18 10:29 PM,i want to read it,
unahb#8581,20-Jun-18 10:29 PM,😦,

MKA#5877,20-Jun-18 10:30 PM,make a reddit post and get a bunch of karma :blobhyperthink:,
Snowfish#4289,20-Jun-18 10:30 PM,i’d have to go back and get logs of the “you’re making me depressed” convo,
Snowfish#4289,20-Jun-18 10:30 PM,that conversation alone make me know that i wasn’t the crazy one,
suyashr99#7560,20-Jun-18 10:30 PM,Diary of a wimpy kid format book but for college,
Snowfish#4289,20-Jun-18 10:30 PM,told,

unahb#8581,20-Jun-18 10:30 PM,@Snowfish#4289 are you graduating?,
Snowfish#4289,20-Jun-18 10:30 PM,at the end of spring yup,
MKA#5877,20-Jun-18 10:31 PM,theres probably someone on campus who will write it for/with you,
suyashr99#7560,20-Jun-18 10:31 PM,A senior by credit hours,
Snowfish#4289,20-Jun-18 10:31 PM,i finally get to say that,
Snowfish#4289,20-Jun-18 10:31 PM,jk i just say “i’m graduating in spring”,
Snowfish#4289,20-Jun-18 10:31 PM,but yeah i dunno,
Snowfish#4289,20-Jun-18 10:32 PM,i’m not the best motivational speaker but i wish i could like properly get across the idea that there’s literally no rush,
Snowfish#4289,20-Jun-18 10:32 PM,"take your time, don’t get sucked into something you don’t really want to do just because you’re trying to win this race with no prize",
Snowfish#4289,20-Jun-18 10:32 PM,it’s genuinely only your future that is affected by college,
unahb#8581,20-Jun-18 10:32 PM,what did you get sucked into,
Snowfish#4289,20-Jun-18 10:32 PM,and i feel like too many people just care about what others think,
Snowfish#4289,20-Jun-18 10:32 PM,well i went into business and i nearly dropped out twice,
mic#7575,20-Jun-18 10:33 PM,only your future as opposed to...?,
Snowfish#4289,20-Jun-18 10:33 PM,i feel like people try to impress others or their parents or something by choosing a hard major or trying to graduate early or something,
Snowfish#4289,20-Jun-18 10:33 PM,but those people are literally just going to go “wow” and that’s it,
Snowfish#4289,20-Jun-18 10:33 PM,like they aren’t the ones that have to go to work every day to a job they hate,
Snowfish#4289,20-Jun-18 10:34 PM,or wake up every morning having regrets,
MKA#5877,20-Jun-18 10:34 PM,no ragrets,
Snowfish#4289,20-Jun-18 10:34 PM,yea no ragrets,

unahb#8581,20-Jun-18 10:34 PM,"ew gross, too involved",
Snowfish#4289,20-Jun-18 10:34 PM,but i quit for my sanity,
unahb#8581,20-Jun-18 10:34 PM,gaming is a mental condition,
Snowfish#4289,20-Jun-18 10:35 PM,:PepeHands:,
Snowfish#4289,20-Jun-18 10:35 PM,it truly is,
Snowfish#4289,20-Jun-18 10:35 PM,"i play indie games ~~and renewed my addiction to world of warcraft~~ now, no collegiate stuff",
Snowfish#4289,20-Jun-18 10:36 PM,though i did have fun playing dota “competitively”,

Snowfish#4289,20-Jun-18 10:36 PM,of course,
Snowfish#4289,20-Jun-18 10:37 PM,it’s actually pretty $$$ if you’re decent,
Snowfish#4289,20-Jun-18 10:37 PM,like one of our  hearthstone teams won $6000 last semester,
Snowfish#4289,20-Jun-18 10:37 PM,uhhh,
Snowfish#4289,20-Jun-18 10:38 PM,csgo has made a lot but i don’t have any #s,
Snowfish#4289,20-Jun-18 10:38 PM,dota is dead but i think they got $500 last semester and $2500?? the year prior,
MKA#5877,20-Jun-18 10:38 PM,is there like a list of games that you sponsor/are affiliated with,
Snowfish#4289,20-Jun-18 10:38 PM,we are pretty much,

Snowfish#4289,20-Jun-18 10:38 PM,"“if you find a collegiate league and have a full team, we’ll pay for it”",
suyashr99#7560,20-Jun-18 10:38 PM,Have your watched gamers?,
Snowfish#4289,20-Jun-18 10:38 PM,but there’s separate clubs that we won’t step on the toes of,

Snowfish#4289,20-Jun-18 10:40 PM,like they pay for the LANs,
Snowfish#4289,20-Jun-18 10:40 PM,and the entry fees,
Snowfish#4289,20-Jun-18 10:41 PM,GTAA is also getting into esports so that’s nice,

saxon_dr#3806,20-Jun-18 10:51 PM,that’s the good thing about csgo,
saxon_dr#3806,20-Jun-18 10:51 PM,there’s depth if u know it but if u don’t u can still get hyped,
suyashr99#7560,20-Jun-18 10:51 PM,Lol I've never played csgo in my life but I've easily watched 200 hrs of CS streams and I knew all the callouts to dust 2,
Snowfish#4289,20-Jun-18 10:51 PM,esports is gonna blow up really soon,
Snowfish#4289,20-Jun-18 10:52 PM,especially once this generation starts having kids,

8726andrew#5709,20-Jun-18 10:57 PM,also most people hate on esports for some reason,

saxon_dr#3806,20-Jun-18 10:58 PM,if u actually explain it to them in a reasonable fashion they get it,
Snowfish#4289,20-Jun-18 10:58 PM,the problem with sports is not everyone can really play it,
suyashr99#7560,20-Jun-18 10:58 PM,Real men get concussions,
Snowfish#4289,20-Jun-18 10:58 PM,esports can appeal to literally anyone,
8726andrew#5709,20-Jun-18 10:58 PM,most people who arent like into video games and stuff,
saxon_dr#3806,20-Jun-18 10:58 PM,but if u just tell them yeah they just play video games for money :haHAA: then they hate on it,
8726andrew#5709,20-Jun-18 10:58 PM,everyone can play sports just like esports,
suyashr99#7560,20-Jun-18 10:58 PM,That's true,
8726andrew#5709,20-Jun-18 10:58 PM,how good you actually are tho depends on your usual parameters of willingness and genetics etc,
suyashr99#7560,20-Jun-18 10:59 PM,Yeah that holds true for esports too,
suyashr99#7560,20-Jun-18 10:59 PM,With reaction time and just situational awareness,
Twinov#6441,20-Jun-18 10:59 PM,In the pros of physical sports you see stuff that is superhuman,
8726andrew#5709,20-Jun-18 11:00 PM,in the pros of esports you see superhuman stuff that you dont know is super human unless you're invested in said game sometimes,
8726andrew#5709,20-Jun-18 11:00 PM,some games are more obvious than others,

Chafos#1781,20-Jun-18 11:30 PM,If not more,
Chafos#1781,20-Jun-18 11:30 PM,internships are typically a really good idea if you want experience for like any career,
Chafos#1781,20-Jun-18 11:31 PM,if you meant co-ops then yeah that percentage was high I was surprised by that,

Gadget246#0848,20-Jun-18 11:53 PM,wow that backlog was *wild*,
Gadget246#0848,20-Jun-18 11:55 PM,I used to be good enough at HS to play in a collegiate team (top 2000 legend) but I quit because blizzard's policies towards competitive play made me sad,
Gadget246#0848,20-Jun-18 11:56 PM,"""let's just nerf one of the meta decks after the deck submission deadline for this major tournament without telling people beforehand or letting them change their decks afterwards"" LUL",
Snowfish#4289,20-Jun-18 11:56 PM,oof,
Gadget246#0848,20-Jun-18 11:58 PM,eventually they changed their minds and let ppl change decks because they got so much outrage on twitter,
Twinov#6441,20-Jun-18 11:58 PM,Yeah the hs competitive scene sucks,
Gadget246#0848,21-Jun-18 12:00 AM,*forces self not to go on rant about hearthstone*,

Twinov#6441,21-Jun-18 12:06 AM,Feels bad man,
Gadget246#0848,21-Jun-18 12:14 AM,economy certainly needs some work but was also better than HS by a good bit last I checked,
Snowfish#4289,21-Jun-18 12:14 AM,HS got that tespa $$$ tho,
Gadget246#0848,21-Jun-18 12:15 AM,"if you think HS has more competitive funding than Magic the frickin Gathering, then you've got another think coming lol",
Twinov#6441,21-Jun-18 12:16 AM,Well magic arena I don't think anyone's playing yet really,
Snowfish#4289,21-Jun-18 12:16 AM,magic the gathering no but,
Gadget246#0848,21-Jun-18 12:16 AM,yeah there aren't tourneys in it yet because it's still in beta,
Snowfish#4289,21-Jun-18 12:16 AM,idk how much they’re gonna pour into arena,
Gadget246#0848,21-Jun-18 12:17 AM,"true, if you actually want to tap into the competitive scene for magic at the moment you could use arena as a place to learn but you'd have to go to paper to actually compete, hopefully that changes in the near future",
Gadget246#0848,21-Jun-18 12:18 AM,also hearthstone is WAY easier than magic,

KyotoKoto#5113,22-Jun-18 10:33 PM,random question but are any of y'all CPR certified,
mic#7575,22-Jun-18 10:35 PM,I used to be,
mic#7575,22-Jun-18 10:35 PM,CPR is mandatory for ninth graders at my school,
mic#7575,22-Jun-18 10:35 PM,then my CPR certification expired and I would probably do it wrong nowadays,
mic#7575,22-Jun-18 10:38 PM,for the step of checking for a pulse I was always checking the wrong part of the wrist and I never knew any better since we did it on a mannequin,
KyotoKoto#5113,22-Jun-18 10:39 PM,how did you end up figuring out that you were checking the wrong part of the wrist?,
joazlazer#2041,22-Jun-18 10:40 PM,I was a year ago,
joazlazer#2041,22-Jun-18 10:41 PM,***are you breathing?!?***,
mic#7575,22-Jun-18 10:42 PM,I wanted to check my heart rate after a run and realized that hey I don't feel a pulse in that stringy part down the middle of my wrist,
KyotoKoto#5113,22-Jun-18 10:43 PM,"rip, guess you're dead",
mic#7575,22-Jun-18 10:43 PM,that does seem to be the most likely conclusion,
mic#7575,22-Jun-18 10:43 PM,btw what does the koto in KyotoKoto mean?,
KyotoKoto#5113,22-Jun-18 10:45 PM,"it's apparently a Japanese instrument, which i was not aware of when i made the username. i was playing minecraft a few months ago and had to make a username, and this is the username that i came up with on the fly",
mic#7575,22-Jun-18 10:46 PM,ahh,
KyotoKoto#5113,22-Jun-18 10:47 PM,i think i just thought the combination of Kyoto and Koto sounded cute and just went with it lol,

mic#7575,22-Jun-18 10:48 PM,I looked it up in my dictionary app and there are quite a lot of things it could be,

efank#9753,24-Jun-18 01:32 PM,@saxon_dr#3806  this is a really popular store for some reason,https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/402517390669381633/460497517142867971/wx_camera_1528467465040.jpg

saxon_dr#3806,24-Jun-18 01:34 PM,if you think of it as another genre,
saxon_dr#3806,24-Jun-18 01:34 PM,it's not bad,
efank#9753,24-Jun-18 01:34 PM,just treat it as a cuisine in and of itself,

efank#9753,24-Jun-18 01:34 PM,I don't get to get Chipotle often,
saxon_dr#3806,24-Jun-18 01:34 PM,my understanding is that chipotle = american mexican food just like chinese american food,
efank#9753,24-Jun-18 01:35 PM,ohh hmm,
efank#9753,24-Jun-18 01:35 PM,@saxon_dr#3806 have you heard of,

efank#9753,24-Jun-18 01:35 PM,the tea,

efank#9753,24-Jun-18 01:36 PM,it just means they dump an entire lemon into your tea,
saxon_dr#3806,24-Jun-18 01:36 PM,which probably will never happen since i don't really leave ma house,
efank#9753,24-Jun-18 01:36 PM,hue,
efank#9753,24-Jun-18 01:37 PM,but the lines are stupidly long,

saxon_dr#3806,24-Jun-18 01:55 PM,well if you live in the west,
efank#9753,24-Jun-18 01:55 PM,the US having multiple tz,

efank#9753,24-Jun-18 01:56 PM,border,
saxon_dr#3806,24-Jun-18 01:57 PM,i think if a city or town is at the border,
saxon_dr#3806,24-Jun-18 01:57 PM,they just decide on which one to use,

waffle.dynasty#2740,24-Jun-18 02:40 PM,How did the subject change to working out?,
waffle.dynasty#2740,24-Jun-18 02:41 PM,Nvm I scrolled up,
brumeux#4293,24-Jun-18 02:46 PM,gt22 discord gym meetup,
saxon_dr#3806,24-Jun-18 03:00 PM,ok i should be easy to find i'm the guy that has no idea what he's doing,
brumeux#4293,24-Jun-18 03:02 PM,we can be a whole pack of clueless people instead of singles,
suyashr99#7560,24-Jun-18 03:05 PM,I know how to do stuff I got y'all,
waffle.dynasty#2740,24-Jun-18 03:08 PM,Do stuff?,
KyotoKoto#5113,24-Jun-18 03:12 PM,"I have 0 clue how to workout, halp",
waffle.dynasty#2740,24-Jun-18 03:13 PM,All the machines have instructions for you,
waffle.dynasty#2740,24-Jun-18 03:14 PM,Also most people at the gym (in my experience) are actually really nice and willing to give you advice,
saxon_dr#3806,24-Jun-18 03:16 PM,oh yeah i for the most part know what i'm doing with the machines and i know hot to hiit with cardio and stuff,
saxon_dr#3806,24-Jun-18 03:16 PM,"but i'm mostly talking about weights, but then they're not really my concern right now i think i'll do more of those when i'm not overweight anymore :lilyChubby:",
waffle.dynasty#2740,24-Jun-18 03:16 PM,Cardio is outside?,
waffle.dynasty#2740,24-Jun-18 03:16 PM,Like running?,
brumeux#4293,24-Jun-18 03:20 PM,it doesnt have to be,
brumeux#4293,24-Jun-18 03:20 PM,running :monkaS:,
waffle.dynasty#2740,24-Jun-18 03:21 PM,I always connected weights to the gym and cardio to outside,
waffle.dynasty#2740,24-Jun-18 03:21 PM,But I guess there are bikes and treadmills,
waffle.dynasty#2740,24-Jun-18 03:21 PM,I have something against those things though,
waffle.dynasty#2740,24-Jun-18 03:22 PM,Honestly whatever works best for you is what you should do,
saxon_dr#3806,24-Jun-18 03:24 PM,i do like running outside more but planning out a route is just too much work for me,
saxon_dr#3806,24-Jun-18 03:24 PM,also i think with machines it's easier to gauge how fast i'm running,
saxon_dr#3806,24-Jun-18 03:24 PM,and also  it's easier on the joints,
brumeux#4293,24-Jun-18 03:24 PM,ah yes my knees hate me for running cross country for 4 years,
brumeux#4293,24-Jun-18 03:25 PM,i think theres a running club at GT so thats a possibility,
brumeux#4293,24-Jun-18 03:25 PM,they must know routes,
waffle.dynasty#2740,24-Jun-18 03:26 PM,I'm also a sprinter so there's differences there,
bopas2#1774,24-Jun-18 03:30 PM,"I hate running on a treadmill tho, so boring. There was a reddit post with good running routes tho if y’all are really interested",
suyashr99#7560,24-Jun-18 03:50 PM,I hate machines lmao,
suyashr99#7560,24-Jun-18 03:50 PM,Free weights are lit,
waffle.dynasty#2740,24-Jun-18 03:50 PM,^,
suyashr99#7560,24-Jun-18 03:52 PM,Machines always feel like they promote bad form,
waffle.dynasty#2740,24-Jun-18 03:52 PM,Idk about that,
waffle.dynasty#2740,24-Jun-18 03:53 PM,I do free weights because that's what we had at my school lol,
suyashr99#7560,24-Jun-18 03:53 PM,I also feel like it's way easier to half ass reps and shit on machines,
waffle.dynasty#2740,24-Jun-18 03:53 PM,True,
waffle.dynasty#2740,24-Jun-18 03:54 PM,Machines are good for targeting specific muscles,
suyashr99#7560,24-Jun-18 03:59 PM,I don't understand how people consider just cardio a good exercise,
suyashr99#7560,24-Jun-18 04:00 PM,You gotta do the muscle training 😭,
waffle.dynasty#2740,24-Jun-18 04:02 PM,Lol I never understood people that don't do cardio,
waffle.dynasty#2740,24-Jun-18 04:02 PM,There's 2 types of people ig,
suyashr99#7560,24-Jun-18 04:06 PM,I only do fun cardio,
waffle.dynasty#2740,24-Jun-18 04:23 PM,I mean if you're not having fun while exerting physical energy then there's no point,
suyashr99#7560,24-Jun-18 04:23 PM,oof,
Gadget246#0848,24-Jun-18 04:32 PM,personally i like to run on an indoor track because you aren't locked in one place like you are on a machine but you also get to be in the AC,
Gadget246#0848,24-Jun-18 04:32 PM,also if you work so hard at the gym that you're too sore to go again in a couple days then you worked too hard,
suyashr99#7560,24-Jun-18 04:34 PM,No,
Gadget246#0848,24-Jun-18 04:34 PM,"work out at whatever level is a challenge for you but isn't so unpleasant that you don't want to do it again in two days, because consistency is more important than intensity",
suyashr99#7560,24-Jun-18 04:34 PM,DOMS is natural,
suyashr99#7560,24-Jun-18 04:35 PM,Atleast in the beginning,
Snowfish#4289,24-Jun-18 04:35 PM,where was i pinged,
suyashr99#7560,24-Jun-18 04:35 PM,I asked about weeb pop at tech,
Snowfish#4289,24-Jun-18 04:36 PM,oh,
Gadget246#0848,24-Jun-18 04:36 PM,"""(DOMS) is the pain and stiffness felt in muscles several hours to days after unaccustomed or strenuous exercise"", you gotta work up to it to avoid DOMS, don't start out by working until you can't go any farther, on your first workout intentionally stop before you max out, and then each workout push yourself a little bit farther until you're able to max out without getting hit with DOMS",
Snowfish#4289,24-Jun-18 04:37 PM,idk i kinda like feeling sore after i work out,
Gadget246#0848,24-Jun-18 04:37 PM,"being sore the next day is ok, being so sore that you miss your next workout is self-defeating",
Snowfish#4289,24-Jun-18 04:37 PM,it’s like “hell yeah i did something”,
Gadget246#0848,24-Jun-18 04:38 PM,"like, i aim for working out every other day, so i try to work hard enough that i'm sore the next day, but that i'm up to working out by the day after",
suyashr99#7560,24-Jun-18 04:38 PM,Yeah but no one really knows what causes doms,
suyashr99#7560,24-Jun-18 04:38 PM,It's not solely based on how hard you go,
Gadget246#0848,24-Jun-18 04:40 PM,"""Delayed onset muscle soreness can be reduced or prevented by gradually increasing the intensity of a new exercise program"" , -Kokkinos, Peter (2009). Physical Activity and Cardiovascular Disease Prevention",
brumeux#4293,24-Jun-18 04:40 PM,schuler is right imo like. at first its important to build the habits',
brumeux#4293,24-Jun-18 04:41 PM,when i was running every day feeling sore was like the cue id done a good job but now that im out of habit the most important thing is that i stay active you know? so if im dreading it im not going to do it,
suyashr99#7560,24-Jun-18 04:42 PM,Yeah I agree that intensity does cause DOMS,
suyashr99#7560,24-Jun-18 04:42 PM,But it depends on what your goal is,
suyashr99#7560,24-Jun-18 04:43 PM,"If you're trying to get muscular, I think you kinda need to get used to soreness. If your only concern is general health and you can't really commit then maybe its best",
suyashr99#7560,24-Jun-18 04:43 PM,"The only reason I would avoid telling a beginner to not push themselves a bit is because then they don't really try to progress in weight and it stifles progress, which kinda happened with me",
Gadget246#0848,24-Jun-18 04:48 PM,"oh yeah, it definitely depends on your goal, if your goal is to get swole quickly then you're gonna have to hurt to accomplish that, if your goal is to start working out to be healthier and/or lose excess weight over the long run then it's not as important to immediately push yourself and you can start out slower to avoid DOMS, And I'm not suggesting that someone should stay at the same weight level if they're ready to move up, just that you should start at a weight that is a little bit too easy for you and then move up each time until you get to the right level for you (and obviously that right level will also increase over time)",
suyashr99#7560,24-Jun-18 04:49 PM,I love doms tbh,
suyashr99#7560,24-Jun-18 04:49 PM,Just not for my legs,
suyashr99#7560,24-Jun-18 04:49 PM,That shit trash,
suyashr99#7560,24-Jun-18 04:50 PM,Every other muscle is just pure joy tho,
waffle.dynasty#2740,24-Jun-18 04:50 PM,Leg day is fye,
Snowfish#4289,24-Jun-18 04:50 PM,all muscles are joy,
suyashr99#7560,24-Jun-18 04:51 PM,I fucking hate leg day,
suyashr99#7560,24-Jun-18 04:51 PM,I've puked twice while working out and those were both leg day,
waffle.dynasty#2740,24-Jun-18 04:52 PM,Well I do high reps medium weight when I work out so leg day is fun,
Gadget246#0848,24-Jun-18 04:52 PM,"i mean, the soreness means you made progress, so as long as it doesn't stop you from working out being sore is a healthy thing, i also like it",
suyashr99#7560,24-Jun-18 04:52 PM,High reps :PepeHands:,
waffle.dynasty#2740,24-Jun-18 04:52 PM,My favorite is core then legs and arms are my least favorite,
Gadget246#0848,24-Jun-18 04:52 PM,"when you say 'high reps' how many are you talking, just out of curiosity",
suyashr99#7560,24-Jun-18 04:53 PM,I like making progress on bench,
suyashr99#7560,24-Jun-18 04:53 PM,Because I'm somewhat tall and skinny so that's the hardest for me to build,
waffle.dynasty#2740,24-Jun-18 04:53 PM,16-20 @Gadget246#0848,
suyashr99#7560,24-Jun-18 04:53 PM,But back is probably my favorite along with arms,
waffle.dynasty#2740,24-Jun-18 04:53 PM,Most people do at most 10 reps per set I think,
Snowfish#4289,24-Jun-18 04:53 PM,my apartment complex pretty much only has a treadmill :PepeHands:,
Gadget246#0848,24-Jun-18 04:53 PM,"thanks, my favorite is making progress on squats because i have awful knees",
suyashr99#7560,24-Jun-18 04:54 PM,"I do 8-10, 5 if I'm doing squats or really high bench",
waffle.dynasty#2740,24-Jun-18 04:55 PM,@suyashr99#7560 I had prescribed workouts for track in hs so I'm comfortable with what I was forced to do for so long,
waffle.dynasty#2740,24-Jun-18 04:55 PM,Its not what people do normally at the gym but it's what I'm used to,
Snowfish#4289,24-Jun-18 04:55 PM,that sounds nice,
suyashr99#7560,24-Jun-18 04:55 PM,Oh I was just saying what I do,
waffle.dynasty#2740,24-Jun-18 04:55 PM,Yeah you do the normal thing,
waffle.dynasty#2740,24-Jun-18 04:56 PM,Gets you BIG,
Gadget246#0848,24-Jun-18 04:56 PM,"i do 8-12 cause i'm more interested in endurance than gains, but i'm considering changing that for squats since tenor drums really kill my knees when i have to squat to pick something up while wearing them and that's a max weight thing rather than an endurance thing",
suyashr99#7560,24-Jun-18 04:56 PM,TFW my arms are bigger than my calves,
suyashr99#7560,24-Jun-18 04:56 PM,:PepeHands:,
waffle.dynasty#2740,24-Jun-18 04:57 PM,Lol,
waffle.dynasty#2740,24-Jun-18 04:57 PM,My arms are not big at all,
waffle.dynasty#2740,24-Jun-18 04:58 PM,You must have ripped arms then,
suyashr99#7560,24-Jun-18 04:59 PM,I have a picture of myself in a dab for America tank top I bought at Walmart,
suyashr99#7560,24-Jun-18 04:59 PM,Also not really it's more like I'm scrawny everywhere else,
suyashr99#7560,24-Jun-18 04:59 PM,I'm 6' and weigh like 144,
waffle.dynasty#2740,24-Jun-18 05:00 PM,12^2 😱,
suyashr99#7560,24-Jun-18 05:00 PM,oof,

suyashr99#7560,24-Jun-18 05:01 PM,I really try hard to eat lol,
unahb#8581,24-Jun-18 05:01 PM,"im kinda fat, need to go on a cutting diet",
suyashr99#7560,24-Jun-18 05:01 PM,I probably only average like 1800 calories a day,
suyashr99#7560,24-Jun-18 05:01 PM,Maybe less,
suyashr99#7560,24-Jun-18 05:02 PM,But it's my maintanence intake,
suyashr99#7560,24-Jun-18 05:02 PM,Gotta get those 3 cups of milk every day,
suyashr99#7560,24-Jun-18 05:02 PM,And a protein shake,
suyashr99#7560,24-Jun-18 05:02 PM,😤,
waffle.dynasty#2740,24-Jun-18 05:02 PM,Lol until last year I thought it was 2000 calories a meal,
unahb#8581,24-Jun-18 05:02 PM,😤 💪 💪,
waffle.dynasty#2740,24-Jun-18 05:02 PM,"I missed the ""per day"" part on labels",
unahb#8581,24-Jun-18 05:02 PM,boi wtf,
unahb#8581,24-Jun-18 05:03 PM,you ate 6000 calories a day?,
waffle.dynasty#2740,24-Jun-18 05:03 PM,No,
waffle.dynasty#2740,24-Jun-18 05:03 PM,I don't think so,
waffle.dynasty#2740,24-Jun-18 05:03 PM,I've never counted calories,
waffle.dynasty#2740,24-Jun-18 05:03 PM,I was just misinformed,
suyashr99#7560,24-Jun-18 05:04 PM,I think the rock eats 2000 a meal,
waffle.dynasty#2740,24-Jun-18 05:04 PM,GAINS,
KyotoKoto#5113,24-Jun-18 05:05 PM,gotta get thicc,
waffle.dynasty#2740,24-Jun-18 05:05 PM,I personally think counting calories makes being healthy too complicated,
waffle.dynasty#2740,24-Jun-18 05:05 PM,Too much math,
suyashr99#7560,24-Jun-18 05:06 PM,I don't think I'm at the point where I need to count calories as much as I just need to eat more m,
suyashr99#7560,24-Jun-18 05:06 PM,Maybe when my metabolism slows down,
8726andrew#5709,24-Jun-18 05:15 PM,It matters if you wanna get big,
8726andrew#5709,24-Jun-18 05:15 PM,You gotta be religious with how much you eat apparently,
8726andrew#5709,24-Jun-18 05:16 PM,I’m a stick and I run so I’m out on both counts,
Twinov#6441,24-Jun-18 05:16 PM,Just use myfitnesspal,
Twinov#6441,24-Jun-18 05:16 PM,Easy to keep track of what you eat,
suyashr99#7560,24-Jun-18 05:18 PM,I'm just gonna dirty bulk at this point,
Snowfish#4289,24-Jun-18 05:18 PM,tf is a dirty bulk,
Snowfish#4289,24-Jun-18 05:18 PM,you boys with your MUSCLES,
Snowfish#4289,24-Jun-18 05:18 PM,smh,
Twinov#6441,24-Jun-18 05:18 PM,I only got chicken arms (doms) the first time I worked out,
Twinov#6441,24-Jun-18 05:18 PM,Took 2 days off and couldn't move my arms,
suyashr99#7560,24-Jun-18 05:19 PM,@Snowfish#4289 not eating perfectly healthy,
Twinov#6441,24-Jun-18 05:19 PM,But haven't got it since,
suyashr99#7560,24-Jun-18 05:19 PM,Like not eating chicken breasts and Broccoli for every meal,
waffle.dynasty#2740,24-Jun-18 05:19 PM,Ewwww,
suyashr99#7560,24-Jun-18 05:19 PM,I can't do that shit,
waffle.dynasty#2740,24-Jun-18 05:20 PM,Brittain better not run out of milk,
suyashr99#7560,24-Jun-18 05:20 PM,I fucking love whole milk,
waffle.dynasty#2740,24-Jun-18 05:21 PM,Bruh,
waffle.dynasty#2740,24-Jun-18 05:21 PM,My brother and I go through 3 gallons a week,
waffle.dynasty#2740,24-Jun-18 05:21 PM,I'm not trying to buy milk though so GTDining better come through,
suyashr99#7560,24-Jun-18 05:22 PM,Bring a cow with you,
Snowfish#4289,24-Jun-18 05:22 PM,there's a milk machine in al of the dining halls,
Snowfish#4289,24-Jun-18 05:22 PM,with soy milk almond milk normal milk and chocolate milk iirc,
waffle.dynasty#2740,24-Jun-18 05:23 PM,If I bring a bottle will they get mad at me for taking milk to-go,
Snowfish#4289,24-Jun-18 05:24 PM,yes,
Snowfish#4289,24-Jun-18 05:24 PM,but you can just put it in your backpack,
Snowfish#4289,24-Jun-18 05:24 PM,and be slick,
Snowfish#4289,24-Jun-18 05:24 PM,i used to smuggle like entire meals out of there,
Snowfish#4289,24-Jun-18 05:24 PM,:),
waffle.dynasty#2740,24-Jun-18 05:24 PM,Awesome,
suyashr99#7560,24-Jun-18 05:24 PM,Don't they have to go boxes tho,
Snowfish#4289,24-Jun-18 05:24 PM,not in dining halls,
suyashr99#7560,24-Jun-18 05:25 PM,oof,
Snowfish#4289,24-Jun-18 05:25 PM,although,
Snowfish#4289,24-Jun-18 05:25 PM,since there's no longer any unlimited swipes,
Snowfish#4289,24-Jun-18 05:25 PM,they might have that stuff now,
Snowfish#4289,24-Jun-18 05:25 PM,unsure,
Snowfish#4289,24-Jun-18 05:25 PM,i feel bad for you guys,
Snowfish#4289,24-Jun-18 05:26 PM,unlimited swipes was the BOMB,
Snowfish#4289,24-Jun-18 05:26 PM,i'd walk into both dining halsl just to check what kind of cookies they had at like 9PM,
Snowfish#4289,24-Jun-18 05:26 PM,god bless,
waffle.dynasty#2740,24-Jun-18 05:27 PM,What do we have now then?,
Snowfish#4289,24-Jun-18 05:27 PM,like 350 or some shit,
Snowfish#4289,24-Jun-18 05:27 PM,its because of west village,
Snowfish#4289,24-Jun-18 05:27 PM,WV is like 2 swipes for a meal or something,
Snowfish#4289,24-Jun-18 05:27 PM,so having unlimited was op,
waffle.dynasty#2740,24-Jun-18 05:27 PM,Dang that sounds awesome,
waffle.dynasty#2740,24-Jun-18 05:27 PM,I'm jealous,
Snowfish#4289,24-Jun-18 05:28 PM,well,
Snowfish#4289,24-Jun-18 05:28 PM,it went away when WV was made,
Snowfish#4289,24-Jun-18 05:28 PM,so,
Snowfish#4289,24-Jun-18 05:28 PM,i didnt get to break the system,
Snowfish#4289,24-Jun-18 05:28 PM,i actuially really liked the dining halls on campus though,
Snowfish#4289,24-Jun-18 05:28 PM,like the meals werent 5 star gordon ramsey or whatever,
Snowfish#4289,24-Jun-18 05:28 PM,"but its convenient, the staff is nice, and it was always really comfy in there",
waffle.dynasty#2740,24-Jun-18 05:28 PM,Probably better than hs lunch,
Snowfish#4289,24-Jun-18 05:29 PM,absolutely,
Snowfish#4289,24-Jun-18 05:29 PM,my only complaint is that during off hours theres like _nothing_,
Snowfish#4289,24-Jun-18 05:29 PM,"like they serve food at breakfast, lunch, dinner",
Snowfish#4289,24-Jun-18 05:29 PM,"like 8AM, 12PM, 5PM sharp",
Snowfish#4289,24-Jun-18 05:29 PM,serve for an hour,
Snowfish#4289,24-Jun-18 05:29 PM,then stop,
Snowfish#4289,24-Jun-18 05:29 PM,so if you have class from like 11-2,
Snowfish#4289,24-Jun-18 05:29 PM,what do u do?,
waffle.dynasty#2740,24-Jun-18 05:29 PM,Oh no,

Snowfish#4289,24-Jun-18 05:29 PM,burgers,
waffle.dynasty#2740,24-Jun-18 05:29 PM,I eat dinner at like 8pm,
Snowfish#4289,24-Jun-18 05:29 PM,some fries,
Snowfish#4289,24-Jun-18 05:29 PM,salads,
Snowfish#4289,24-Jun-18 05:29 PM,thats it,
Snowfish#4289,24-Jun-18 05:30 PM,i mean it makes sense,
Snowfish#4289,24-Jun-18 05:30 PM,cuz theyd waste a fuckton of food,
waffle.dynasty#2740,24-Jun-18 05:30 PM,Is there a nacho bar?,
Snowfish#4289,24-Jun-18 05:30 PM,if they just made food,
Snowfish#4289,24-Jun-18 05:30 PM,no,
Snowfish#4289,24-Jun-18 05:30 PM,from what i can rememer,
Snowfish#4289,24-Jun-18 05:30 PM,there's like pizza,
Snowfish#4289,24-Jun-18 05:30 PM,then some other stuff i never touched,
Snowfish#4289,24-Jun-18 05:30 PM,a waffle/pancake/whatever bar,
Snowfish#4289,24-Jun-18 05:30 PM,"two serving places (one usually for like pasta, etc and the other for pretty much whatever the big meal of the day is)",
Snowfish#4289,24-Jun-18 05:31 PM,"then they have a little burger place that has quesadillas, fries, and some other stuff depending on the day",
Snowfish#4289,24-Jun-18 05:31 PM,"then there's like a drink station with milk and cereal and one of those coke machines with 50000 different flavors, then some juice i think",
Snowfish#4289,24-Jun-18 05:31 PM,then a salad bar,
Snowfish#4289,24-Jun-18 05:31 PM,then like a toast bar that has every sort of jam/butter/whatever,
Snowfish#4289,24-Jun-18 05:31 PM,and thats pretty much every dining hall,
Snowfish#4289,24-Jun-18 05:32 PM,or well,
Snowfish#4289,24-Jun-18 05:32 PM,i guess _both_ now,
Snowfish#4289,24-Jun-18 05:32 PM,idk what the fuck WV is about since i didnt get a meal plan,
waffle.dynasty#2740,24-Jun-18 05:33 PM,Seems good enough for me,
waffle.dynasty#2740,24-Jun-18 05:33 PM,I'm not picky,
Snowfish#4289,24-Jun-18 05:33 PM,https://menus.sodexomyway.com/BiteMenu/Menu?menuId=842&locationId=54348033&whereami=https://gatechdining-test.sodexomyway.com/dining-near-me/resident-dining,
Snowfish#4289,24-Jun-18 05:33 PM,this kinda sorta shows stuff,
Snowfish#4289,24-Jun-18 05:33 PM,sometimes its wrong,
Snowfish#4289,24-Jun-18 05:33 PM,nvm this looks so much fucking better than what i had wtf,
Snowfish#4289,24-Jun-18 05:33 PM,this is probably accurate,
Snowfish#4289,24-Jun-18 05:33 PM,we'd get like a shitty pdf,
waffle.dynasty#2740,24-Jun-18 05:34 PM,Dang that's some gourmet stuff,
waffle.dynasty#2740,24-Jun-18 05:35 PM,Cornflake cod sandwich :EZ:,
Snowfish#4289,24-Jun-18 05:35 PM,like i said,
Snowfish#4289,24-Jun-18 05:35 PM,not amazing but better than decent imo,
Snowfish#4289,24-Jun-18 05:35 PM,people who complains about it are typically people who for some reason expect it to be a 5 star restaurant,
suyashr99#7560,24-Jun-18 05:35 PM,Sodexoooo,
suyashr99#7560,24-Jun-18 05:36 PM,That's the supplier for like all the shitty chain restaurants that microwave meals,
suyashr99#7560,24-Jun-18 05:36 PM,"Like some shit at Olive garden, Applebee's, tgif",
Snowfish#4289,24-Jun-18 05:36 PM,yeah,
Snowfish#4289,24-Jun-18 05:36 PM,sodexo sux but its really in the employees imo,
Snowfish#4289,24-Jun-18 05:36 PM,like there's a pretty biiiig difference in meal quality depending on who is on duty,
waffle.dynasty#2740,24-Jun-18 05:36 PM,My hs uses sodexo :haHAA:,
Snowfish#4289,24-Jun-18 05:37 PM,oof,

suyashr99#7560,24-Jun-18 11:33 PM,slack :OMEGALUL:,
thedragonlegacy#2854,24-Jun-18 11:33 PM,so all these dumba$$ groupchats wont be continuously be created,
thedragonlegacy#2854,24-Jun-18 11:33 PM,no bot thots infiltration,
Snowfish#4289,24-Jun-18 11:33 PM,slack is lit,
thedragonlegacy#2854,24-Jun-18 11:34 PM,and its fkin easier to mod,
thedragonlegacy#2854,24-Jun-18 11:35 PM,is it a thought idea or thot idea?,
suyashr99#7560,24-Jun-18 11:35 PM,They're not gonna do it,
Quantum#1480,24-Jun-18 11:35 PM,It's going to have a huge dropoff,

Snowfish#4289,24-Jun-18 11:36 PM,like you dont have to be an admin to make channels,
Snowfish#4289,24-Jun-18 11:36 PM,so you can make your own personal discussion channels without a mod,

Snowfish#4289,24-Jun-18 11:36 PM,its actually really nice,
Quantum#1480,24-Jun-18 11:36 PM,It may be worth convincing a major groupchat to switch first,

saxon_dr#3806,25-Jun-18 02:17 AM,ah fk this talk is making me think maybe i should go to gym after all,
ratarafu#1603,25-Jun-18 02:18 AM,@Cole#0059 You bench 100 at 115?,

suyashr99#7560,25-Jun-18 02:18 AM,That's really impressive,
Cole#0059,25-Jun-18 02:18 AM,"I weigh 115, at 5'10"" and i max 100 bench 1 rep",
suyashr99#7560,25-Jun-18 02:18 AM,100 is prob my 1 rep max for bench,
suyashr99#7560,25-Jun-18 02:19 AM,Oh,
suyashr99#7560,25-Jun-18 02:19 AM,Ok understandable,
Cole#0059,25-Jun-18 02:19 AM,"ya, but im severely underweight",
ratarafu#1603,25-Jun-18 02:19 AM,Downside of being tall is slow gains.,
suyashr99#7560,25-Jun-18 02:20 AM,I was pretty underweight until last year,
suyashr99#7560,25-Jun-18 02:20 AM,Then I gained 20 lbs one summer,
suyashr99#7560,25-Jun-18 02:20 AM,And felt so fat,
suyashr99#7560,25-Jun-18 02:20 AM,Body dismorphia amiright,
ratarafu#1603,25-Jun-18 02:20 AM,20 lbs fat or muscle? :p,
suyashr99#7560,25-Jun-18 02:20 AM,Fat,

unahb#8581,25-Jun-18 02:20 AM,its super easy,
suyashr99#7560,25-Jun-18 02:20 AM,I've never gained weight like that before,
suyashr99#7560,25-Jun-18 02:20 AM,So I was fucking scared,
ratarafu#1603,25-Jun-18 02:20 AM,Is it your meds?,
suyashr99#7560,25-Jun-18 02:20 AM,No,
suyashr99#7560,25-Jun-18 02:21 AM,I was just in California,
suyashr99#7560,25-Jun-18 02:21 AM,Eating like even more shit,
unahb#8581,25-Jun-18 02:21 AM,😮,
suyashr99#7560,25-Jun-18 02:21 AM,Like my aunt who I was staying with would force me to eat,
suyashr99#7560,25-Jun-18 02:21 AM,So much food,
ratarafu#1603,25-Jun-18 02:22 AM,I gained like 10 lbs muscle in the last 6 months. Sort of slow cause I can't control my diet much while living at home.,
ratarafu#1603,25-Jun-18 02:22 AM,Also I was only doing bodyweight mostly.,
suyashr99#7560,25-Jun-18 02:22 AM,My metabolism doesnt let me gain weight unless I eat food til i puke @unahb#8581,
ratarafu#1603,25-Jun-18 02:23 AM,The theory about metabolism has been disproved.,
KyotoKoto#5113,25-Jun-18 02:23 AM,what's your theory?,
suyashr99#7560,25-Jun-18 02:23 AM,Really ?,
ratarafu#1603,25-Jun-18 02:23 AM,Calories in - Calories out = weight gain,
suyashr99#7560,25-Jun-18 02:23 AM,I just feel full at approx 1800 calories,
suyashr99#7560,25-Jun-18 02:23 AM,So I assumed that was my maintanence intake,
ratarafu#1603,25-Jun-18 02:23 AM,"Yeah, that's genetic related to stomach hormones",
suyashr99#7560,25-Jun-18 02:24 AM,Which it kinda is,
ratarafu#1603,25-Jun-18 02:24 AM,some people feel full sooner.,
suyashr99#7560,25-Jun-18 02:24 AM,"And at around 2,500 I'm at 🤮",
ratarafu#1603,25-Jun-18 02:24 AM,ghrelin and all that jazz (did I spell it right),
unahb#8581,25-Jun-18 02:24 AM,yikes,
unahb#8581,25-Jun-18 02:24 AM,i wish i had a better metabolic rate,
suyashr99#7560,25-Jun-18 02:25 AM,Alright I'm going to sleep,
suyashr99#7560,25-Jun-18 02:26 AM,This is harming my gains :GWnanamiBurgSlut:,

efank#9753,25-Jun-18 11:16 AM,@Snowfish#4289  do you have any experience requesting pre-requisite overrides?,
Snowfish#4289,25-Jun-18 11:17 AM,once i emailed my advisor asking about it,
Snowfish#4289,25-Jun-18 11:17 AM,i got a firm “no”,
Snowfish#4289,25-Jun-18 11:17 AM,but then again i’m pretty sure i have the worst advisor in the entire college so,
Snowfish#4289,25-Jun-18 11:17 AM,take it with a grain of salt,
efank#9753,25-Jun-18 11:17 AM,are you supposed,

joazlazer#2041,25-Jun-18 11:19 AM,yeah most of it,

joazlazer#2041,25-Jun-18 11:26 AM,youre not a current student,
joazlazer#2041,25-Jun-18 11:26 AM,change my mind,
suyashr99#7560,25-Jun-18 11:27 AM,Ok but it's summer break,
joazlazer#2041,25-Jun-18 11:27 AM,not for me,
joazlazer#2041,25-Jun-18 11:27 AM,:EZ:,
suyashr99#7560,25-Jun-18 11:27 AM,Not all current students do summer semester,
joazlazer#2041,25-Jun-18 11:27 AM,more like,
joazlazer#2041,25-Jun-18 11:27 AM,:PepeHands:,
joazlazer#2041,25-Jun-18 11:27 AM,ngl,
joazlazer#2041,25-Jun-18 11:27 AM,i was forced into this :FeelsBadMan:,
suyashr99#7560,25-Jun-18 11:28 AM,:OOF:,
joazlazer#2041,25-Jun-18 11:28 AM,p sure 99% of the summer freshmen are tho,
joazlazer#2041,25-Jun-18 11:28 AM,literally <5 people out of 300 voluntarily wanted to do this,
suyashr99#7560,25-Jun-18 11:29 AM,I've heard people say looking back it helped them tho,
suyashr99#7560,25-Jun-18 11:29 AM,It padded their GPA,
joazlazer#2041,25-Jun-18 11:30 AM,gpa padding :FeelsGoodMan:,
joazlazer#2041,25-Jun-18 11:30 AM,an even earlier accumulation of debt :FeelsBadMan:,
Twinov#6441,25-Jun-18 11:30 AM,Why do you have to do a summer?,
joazlazer#2041,25-Jun-18 11:30 AM,"i was ""accepted into the summer 2018 semester""",
suyashr99#7560,25-Jun-18 11:30 AM,Admissions probably forced him,
joazlazer#2041,25-Jun-18 11:30 AM,even tho i applied for fall 2018,
joazlazer#2041,25-Jun-18 11:31 AM,:NotLikeThis:,
joazlazer#2041,25-Jun-18 11:31 AM,so if i want to go to tech (dream + meme school btw),
Snowfish#4289,25-Jun-18 11:31 AM,i’m just going to delete the current student role in august,
joazlazer#2041,25-Jun-18 11:31 AM,i have to do summer,
Snowfish#4289,25-Jun-18 11:31 AM,so it’s not really that relevant,
joazlazer#2041,25-Jun-18 11:31 AM,it is to me smh,
joazlazer#2041,25-Jun-18 11:31 AM,./s,
Snowfish#4289,25-Jun-18 11:31 AM,listen you’ll get a bunch of stupid questions,
Snowfish#4289,25-Jun-18 11:31 AM,u don’t want that,
joazlazer#2041,25-Jun-18 11:31 AM,its ok i know how to print a paper,
joazlazer#2041,25-Jun-18 11:31 AM,i can answer that now,
Snowfish#4289,25-Jun-18 11:31 AM,“hello yes can i exempt literally every class?”,
Snowfish#4289,25-Jun-18 11:31 AM,"“no, you can’t.”",
Snowfish#4289,25-Jun-18 11:32 AM,“wtf why”,
joazlazer#2041,25-Jun-18 11:32 AM,iirc you can only have 9 CH of advanced standing,
joazlazer#2041,25-Jun-18 11:32 AM,see how easily I answered that question :EZ:,
suyashr99#7560,25-Jun-18 11:32 AM,t. Sophomore by credit hours,
Snowfish#4289,25-Jun-18 11:32 AM,uh,
joazlazer#2041,25-Jun-18 11:32 AM,sophmore by credit hours btw,
joazlazer#2041,25-Jun-18 11:32 AM,:haHAA:,
waffle.dynasty#2740,25-Jun-18 11:32 AM,What's the difference between advanced standing and ap credit?,
Snowfish#4289,25-Jun-18 11:32 AM,senior by credit hours btw,
Snowfish#4289,25-Jun-18 11:33 AM,advanced standing is GT’s own exemption,
Snowfish#4289,25-Jun-18 11:33 AM,AP is from the college board,
joazlazer#2041,25-Jun-18 11:33 AM,"""Students may not use more than 9 credits of advanced standing to meet degree requirements.""",
joazlazer#2041,25-Jun-18 11:33 AM,thats not AP,
joazlazer#2041,25-Jun-18 11:33 AM,thats ~~tests~~ testing out of classes,
waffle.dynasty#2740,25-Jun-18 11:33 AM,So if someone didn't get a high enough ap score they'd take that advanced standing test?,
joazlazer#2041,25-Jun-18 11:34 AM,for physics at least,
suyashr99#7560,25-Jun-18 11:34 AM,Or there's no ap class,
joazlazer#2041,25-Jun-18 11:34 AM,they offer that,
joazlazer#2041,25-Jun-18 11:34 AM,@efank#9753 idk if u want this but this is the form https://registrar.gatech.edu/info/advanced-standing-form,
joazlazer#2041,25-Jun-18 11:34 AM,by,
joazlazer#2041,25-Jun-18 11:34 AM,the,
joazlazer#2041,25-Jun-18 11:34 AM,way,
joazlazer#2041,25-Jun-18 11:35 AM,also we get to use canvas @Snowfish#4289,
Snowfish#4289,25-Jun-18 11:35 AM,i know,
joazlazer#2041,25-Jun-18 11:35 AM,we dont have to deal with the steaming pile of shit that is T-square,
Snowfish#4289,25-Jun-18 11:35 AM,i’m using it rn,
Snowfish#4289,25-Jun-18 11:35 AM,you forget i’m taking classes,
joazlazer#2041,25-Jun-18 11:35 AM,hooray for C/o 22,
suyashr99#7560,25-Jun-18 11:35 AM,T^2,

suyashr99#7560,25-Jun-18 11:35 AM,Kek,
Inko#4822,25-Jun-18 11:35 AM,I like t-square,
suyashr99#7560,25-Jun-18 11:35 AM,Took 30 mins for gradebook to load,
Snowfish#4289,25-Jun-18 11:35 AM,^^^^,
joazlazer#2041,25-Jun-18 11:35 AM,get out,
Snowfish#4289,25-Jun-18 11:35 AM,holy shit i wanted to die,
suyashr99#7560,25-Jun-18 11:36 AM,@Inko#4822 you missed everyone doxxing themselves,
Snowfish#4289,25-Jun-18 11:36 AM,i didn’t think t-square was too awful but jesus canvas is amazing,
Inko#4822,25-Jun-18 11:36 AM,wow when did this happen su,
Inko#4822,25-Jun-18 11:36 AM,I feel like t-square was fine,
Inko#4822,25-Jun-18 11:36 AM,they just needed to make it much faster,
Inko#4822,25-Jun-18 11:36 AM,if they threw some more hardware at it,
Inko#4822,25-Jun-18 11:36 AM,might've been decent,
Quantum#1480,25-Jun-18 11:36 AM,Tsquare was so slow,
efank#9753,25-Jun-18 11:37 AM,whats canvas,
efank#9753,25-Jun-18 11:37 AM,and T^2,
Quantum#1480,25-Jun-18 11:37 AM,Idk I much prefer canvas,
joazlazer#2041,25-Jun-18 11:37 AM,online class websites @efank#9753,
waffle.dynasty#2740,25-Jun-18 11:37 AM,Canvas is great,
joazlazer#2041,25-Jun-18 11:37 AM,like for online homework / documents,
joazlazer#2041,25-Jun-18 11:37 AM,also for grades,
Inko#4822,25-Jun-18 11:37 AM,canvas signup system is trash,
waffle.dynasty#2740,25-Jun-18 11:37 AM,My hs used canvas,
Inko#4822,25-Jun-18 11:37 AM,canvas submission system is trash,
suyashr99#7560,25-Jun-18 11:37 AM,@Quantum#1480 did you have lacey,
Inko#4822,25-Jun-18 11:37 AM,how canvas stores submissions is trash,
MKA#5877,25-Jun-18 11:37 AM,my dual enrollment college used canvas last semester of my senior year,
Quantum#1480,25-Jun-18 11:38 AM,Nah I had Mayer,
MKA#5877,25-Jun-18 11:38 AM,agreed canvas submission isnt good,
Quantum#1480,25-Jun-18 11:38 AM,Thank god,
MKA#5877,25-Jun-18 11:38 AM,also part of that was all of my profs were using it for the first time so they didnt know what to do either,
suyashr99#7560,25-Jun-18 11:38 AM,@Quantum#1480 don't you diss Lacey,
KyotoKoto#5113,25-Jun-18 11:38 AM,t square looks like it was made in the 2000s ngl,
suyashr99#7560,25-Jun-18 11:38 AM,That's my guy,
Quantum#1480,25-Jun-18 11:38 AM,The one lecture that Lacey subbed in for Mayer I was completely lost,
suyashr99#7560,25-Jun-18 11:39 AM,"""am I doing this right?""",
Quantum#1480,25-Jun-18 11:39 AM,Lubinsky though,
Quantum#1480,25-Jun-18 11:39 AM,He was special,
suyashr99#7560,25-Jun-18 11:39 AM,A god,
ratarafu#1603,25-Jun-18 11:39 AM,What classes do you DE students get to take?,
Quantum#1480,25-Jun-18 11:39 AM,I loved him,
suyashr99#7560,25-Jun-18 11:39 AM,A very short man,
suyashr99#7560,25-Jun-18 11:39 AM,But a god,
Snowfish#4289,25-Jun-18 11:39 AM,2551 and 2552 right?,
joazlazer#2041,25-Jun-18 11:39 AM,i thought it was linear and multi,
suyashr99#7560,25-Jun-18 11:39 AM,1554 and 2551,
Snowfish#4289,25-Jun-18 11:39 AM,oh nvm,
Quantum#1480,25-Jun-18 11:39 AM,First year is multivariable calc and linear algebra,
Snowfish#4289,25-Jun-18 11:39 AM,hehe :$,
suyashr99#7560,25-Jun-18 11:39 AM,And Some take diff eq,
Snowfish#4289,25-Jun-18 11:40 AM,i literally didn’t take it exclusively because i didn’t feel like taking the SAT,
Quantum#1480,25-Jun-18 11:40 AM,Second year is combinatorics and diff eq I believe,
Quantum#1480,25-Jun-18 11:40 AM,I didn't take that one though,
Snowfish#4289,25-Jun-18 11:40 AM,god that would’ve been nice,
suyashr99#7560,25-Jun-18 11:41 AM,Did you take sat senior year ?@Snowfish#4289,
efank#9753,25-Jun-18 11:41 AM,have any of you guys,
efank#9753,25-Jun-18 11:41 AM,taken the Number theory course,
Snowfish#4289,25-Jun-18 11:41 AM,no i took it at the end of junior yet,
Snowfish#4289,25-Jun-18 11:41 AM,year*,
joazlazer#2041,25-Jun-18 11:41 AM,the SAT :moon2PLSNO:,
efank#9753,25-Jun-18 11:41 AM,https://www.math.gatech.edu/courses/math/4150,
Snowfish#4289,25-Jun-18 11:41 AM,i took AP calc my sophomore year,
joazlazer#2041,25-Jun-18 11:41 AM,what,
joazlazer#2041,25-Jun-18 11:41 AM,how,
MKA#5877,25-Jun-18 11:42 AM,if i take the theory thread in CS im probably gonna take that number theory course it seemed cool,
efank#9753,25-Jun-18 11:42 AM,i thought AP calc was a sophomore course for a bit,
joazlazer#2041,25-Jun-18 11:42 AM,wait nvm I realized I come fron TN,
Snowfish#4289,25-Jun-18 11:42 AM,tested out of algebra and took trig/precalc as a freshman,
joazlazer#2041,25-Jun-18 11:42 AM,TN public education is a :OMEGALUL:,
Snowfish#4289,25-Jun-18 11:42 AM,it’s not common,
efank#9753,25-Jun-18 11:42 AM,idk i think it is in china,
Snowfish#4289,25-Jun-18 11:42 AM,my high school was nerdy tho,
efank#9753,25-Jun-18 11:42 AM,"half take it freshmen, half take it soph",
Snowfish#4289,25-Jun-18 11:42 AM,ok i meant it’s not common in GA,
Quantum#1480,25-Jun-18 11:42 AM,Ap calc 10th grade is becoming more and more common at my school,
suyashr99#7560,25-Jun-18 11:42 AM,Our school never let us,
suyashr99#7560,25-Jun-18 11:42 AM,Until the class after us,
Snowfish#4289,25-Jun-18 11:43 AM,yeah trig is super easy,
suyashr99#7560,25-Jun-18 11:43 AM,"Then they're like ""yeah you guys can skip fucking algebra""",
Quantum#1480,25-Jun-18 11:43 AM,We have 2 kids doing on campus dual enrollment next year,
Snowfish#4289,25-Jun-18 11:43 AM,“here’s the cosine function”,
suyashr99#7560,25-Jun-18 11:43 AM,I was so mad,
waffle.dynasty#2740,25-Jun-18 11:43 AM,There's no point you'll run out of classes to take,
efank#9753,25-Jun-18 11:43 AM,self study,
efank#9753,25-Jun-18 11:43 AM,lol,
waffle.dynasty#2740,25-Jun-18 11:43 AM,Self study is lame,
Snowfish#4289,25-Jun-18 11:43 AM,"we had linear + multi, diffeq, and number theory offered at my high school",
efank#9753,25-Jun-18 11:43 AM,i'm doing tht rn ish lol,
Quantum#1480,25-Jun-18 11:43 AM,And now we have a freshman in ap calc,
Quantum#1480,25-Jun-18 11:43 AM,When will it end,
Snowfish#4289,25-Jun-18 11:43 AM,ofc it didn’t count at GT,
efank#9753,25-Jun-18 11:43 AM,@Snowfish#4289  did you do cryptography in ur NT class,
Snowfish#4289,25-Jun-18 11:43 AM,because why would it,
Snowfish#4289,25-Jun-18 11:43 AM,didn’t take NY,
Snowfish#4289,25-Jun-18 11:43 AM,NT*,
Snowfish#4289,25-Jun-18 11:44 AM,i took diffeq,
suyashr99#7560,25-Jun-18 11:44 AM,GSMST :GWahreeGrarr:,
efank#9753,25-Jun-18 11:44 AM,ah ok,
efank#9753,25-Jun-18 11:44 AM,but there's only 1 NT course at GT i think,
Snowfish#4289,25-Jun-18 11:44 AM,probably,
Twinov#6441,25-Jun-18 11:44 AM,Wait Calc bc sophomore year?,
Twinov#6441,25-Jun-18 11:44 AM,Or ab,
efank#9753,25-Jun-18 11:45 AM,wait you haven't taken the GT one yet right @Snowfish#4289,
Snowfish#4289,25-Jun-18 11:45 AM,no and i never will,
Snowfish#4289,25-Jun-18 11:45 AM,not required,
Snowfish#4289,25-Jun-18 11:45 AM,bc,
efank#9753,25-Jun-18 11:45 AM,idk what they want out of the cryptography tsuff,
Twinov#6441,25-Jun-18 11:45 AM,Damn,
Twinov#6441,25-Jun-18 11:45 AM,Most kids in my school don't take it lol,
Twinov#6441,25-Jun-18 11:45 AM,Only honors track goes to bc,
Snowfish#4289,25-Jun-18 11:46 AM,i went to the biggest tryhard high school in the state,
Snowfish#4289,25-Jun-18 11:46 AM,they basically laughed at you if you tried to take AB,
efank#9753,25-Jun-18 11:46 AM,explains it i guess,
joazlazer#2041,25-Jun-18 11:46 AM,i wish i had gone to a good school :FeelsBadMan:,
Snowfish#4289,25-Jun-18 11:46 AM,“what? do you not LOVE yourself?”,
Snowfish#4289,25-Jun-18 11:46 AM,it doesn’t really make a difference,
Snowfish#4289,25-Jun-18 11:46 AM,all i learned was how to be even more lazy in college,
efank#9753,25-Jun-18 11:46 AM,i really don't think,
efank#9753,25-Jun-18 11:46 AM,when you learn bc makes a differenec,
Snowfish#4289,25-Jun-18 11:47 AM,since its basically just 3 more years of high school,
ratarafu#1603,25-Jun-18 11:47 AM,@joazlazer#2041 same,
efank#9753,25-Jun-18 11:47 AM,i fought the school a lot to take it earlier,
udishab#2211,25-Jun-18 11:47 AM,gsmst right? @Snowfish#4289,
Snowfish#4289,25-Jun-18 11:47 AM,yea,

waffle.dynasty#2740,25-Jun-18 11:48 AM,Try hards smh,
Snowfish#4289,25-Jun-18 11:48 AM,it was in freshman year,
Snowfish#4289,25-Jun-18 11:48 AM,then i got accustomed to it,
Snowfish#4289,25-Jun-18 11:48 AM,now i’m a lazy piece of shit,
Snowfish#4289,25-Jun-18 11:49 AM,granted freshman year was the weed out year,
KyotoKoto#5113,25-Jun-18 11:49 AM,"my high school was like a wanna be GSMST, , people got so stressed that the school had to start monthly ""stress awareness days""/ no homework days to try to ""alleviate stress""",
joazlazer#2041,25-Jun-18 11:49 AM,what weed-out classes do you remember in particular @Snowfish#4289,
joazlazer#2041,25-Jun-18 11:49 AM,also was it really weed-out if gtech has a 97% retention?,
Snowfish#4289,25-Jun-18 11:49 AM,sorry i was talking about high school,
joazlazer#2041,25-Jun-18 11:49 AM,ohhh,
Snowfish#4289,25-Jun-18 11:49 AM,but most GT weeding out is by major,

Snowfish#4289,25-Jun-18 05:59 PM,we're still having a disagreement about making a poster board or not,
joazlazer#2041,25-Jun-18 05:59 PM,you were further from the nerd clubs than i expected,
joazlazer#2041,25-Jun-18 05:59 PM,like actually with the sports,
joazlazer#2041,25-Jun-18 05:59 PM,but other than that idk,
joazlazer#2041,25-Jun-18 05:59 PM,i mean,
suyashr99#7560,25-Jun-18 05:59 PM,Lol what,

joazlazer#2041,25-Jun-18 05:59 PM,but like,
Snowfish#4289,25-Jun-18 05:59 PM,i think its more of a question like,
joazlazer#2041,25-Jun-18 05:59 PM,the clubs that didnt have posters,
joazlazer#2041,25-Jun-18 05:59 PM,were super annoying,
Snowfish#4289,25-Jun-18 05:59 PM,assuming someone didnt know we have esports,
joazlazer#2041,25-Jun-18 06:00 PM,like i actually had to *talk to people*,
Snowfish#4289,25-Jun-18 06:00 PM,would they recognize us,

Samsung#6949,25-Jun-18 07:47 PM,All the games that you can sink that kind of time in aren't really the most enjoyable hours,
MEE6#4876,25-Jun-18 07:47 PM,"GG @Samsung#6949, you just advanced to level 8!",
KyotoKoto#5113,25-Jun-18 07:47 PM,"a little off topic, but have any of you guys played doki doki literature club lol",
bopas2#1774,25-Jun-18 07:47 PM,grinding isn't fun for me,
Snowfish#4289,25-Jun-18 07:47 PM,:GWnanamiTuturu: me,
Samsung#6949,25-Jun-18 07:48 PM,"Dota, WoW, other comp multiplayer type things are all like that",
Samsung#6949,25-Jun-18 07:48 PM,I have as well,
Gadget246#0848,25-Jun-18 07:48 PM,dota is fun as long as you *never* solo or 2-person queue for any reason,
Samsung#6949,25-Jun-18 07:48 PM,uhhh,
Snowfish#4289,25-Jun-18 07:48 PM,dota fucking sucks,
Gadget246#0848,25-Jun-18 07:48 PM,because then you can have fun chatting with friends even when you're losing,
Snowfish#4289,25-Jun-18 07:48 PM,but that's a rant for another time,
Samsung#6949,25-Jun-18 07:48 PM,Debatable depending on the patch,
Snowfish#4289,25-Jun-18 07:48 PM,WoW is mostly enjoyable for me,
Samsung#6949,25-Jun-18 07:48 PM,Cause sometimes you can be in a 5stack and still want to kill yourself,
Snowfish#4289,25-Jun-18 07:48 PM,i guess its just boring right now since its the end of the expac and im only one boss away from completing the highest tier on the hardest difficulty,
Snowfish#4289,25-Jun-18 07:49 PM,like on tuesday we're probably ognna kill it so i literally have no content left for the expansion come tomrrow,
Gadget246#0848,25-Jun-18 07:49 PM,"occasionally a 5stack can be unfun, but only when people get too invested in winning",
suyashr99#7560,25-Jun-18 07:49 PM,Bruh I go out to dinner,
suyashr99#7560,25-Jun-18 07:49 PM,And I miss this,
suyashr99#7560,25-Jun-18 07:49 PM,Man,
suyashr99#7560,25-Jun-18 07:49 PM,I m never leaving,
KyotoKoto#5113,25-Jun-18 07:49 PM,"@Snowfish#4289 i've played doki doki for a little bit, but it's still just qt anime girls, just waiting for the gory stuff (or so i've been told?) to come up , , or i'm just getting trolled and the entire game is just qt anime grills :thonk:",
Gadget246#0848,25-Jun-18 07:50 PM,if you play dota casually instead of competitively it makes you want to die much much less often,
Snowfish#4289,25-Jun-18 07:50 PM,its decent,
Snowfish#4289,25-Jun-18 07:50 PM,just keep playing it,
Snowfish#4289,25-Jun-18 07:50 PM,it does have a tonal shift eventually,
suyashr99#7560,25-Jun-18 07:50 PM,Doki Doki,
Samsung#6949,25-Jun-18 07:50 PM,If you're against unbalanced bs heroes (esp when its like the same drafts every game) it's real annoying,
Snowfish#4289,25-Jun-18 07:50 PM,my problem with dota is like,
Samsung#6949,25-Jun-18 07:50 PM,I'm looking at 6.83 really,
Snowfish#4289,25-Jun-18 07:50 PM,once you get to a certain level,
Snowfish#4289,25-Jun-18 07:50 PM,you cant have fun anymore,
Snowfish#4289,25-Jun-18 07:50 PM,nobody wants to play casually,
Samsung#6949,25-Jun-18 07:50 PM,^,
Snowfish#4289,25-Jun-18 07:50 PM,and if you play with your bad friends,
Gadget246#0848,25-Jun-18 07:50 PM,don't ever get good then EZ,
Snowfish#4289,25-Jun-18 07:50 PM,you're just making it unenjoyable for them,
Snowfish#4289,25-Jun-18 07:50 PM,since youre raising the MMR,
Snowfish#4289,25-Jun-18 07:51 PM,so then they dont want to play with you,
Gadget246#0848,25-Jun-18 07:51 PM,i'm unranked and have never calibrated and never plan to calibrate,
Snowfish#4289,25-Jun-18 07:51 PM,there's still an unranked mmr,
Snowfish#4289,25-Jun-18 07:51 PM,¯\_(ツ)_/¯,
Samsung#6949,25-Jun-18 07:51 PM,Yea,
Gadget246#0848,25-Jun-18 07:51 PM,"oh, dang, make a smurf then i guess?",
Snowfish#4289,25-Jun-18 07:51 PM,smurfs calibrate very quickly,
Snowfish#4289,25-Jun-18 07:52 PM,youd have to make a smurf and forget all of your muscle memroy,
Samsung#6949,25-Jun-18 07:52 PM,The game makes skill-based matchmaking part of its integral feature,
Gadget246#0848,25-Jun-18 07:52 PM,darn dota being too high quality of a game :NotLikeThis:,
Chafos#1781,25-Jun-18 07:52 PM,is this #general or #dota :blobthinkingdown:,
Snowfish#4289,25-Jun-18 07:52 PM,:PepeHands:,
Snowfish#4289,25-Jun-18 07:52 PM,its not like i was even that good,
Snowfish#4289,25-Jun-18 07:52 PM,but it was substantial enough to ruin the experience for everyone,
Snowfish#4289,25-Jun-18 07:52 PM,it made me toxic,
Snowfish#4289,25-Jun-18 07:52 PM,nobody was having fun,
Samsung#6949,25-Jun-18 07:53 PM,Yeah I'm like ok,
Snowfish#4289,25-Jun-18 07:53 PM,so i quit,
Gadget246#0848,25-Jun-18 07:53 PM,"in that case sounds like you're kinda boned, sorry you got stuck like that",
Snowfish#4289,25-Jun-18 07:53 PM,i was like low 4k which is like,
Snowfish#4289,25-Jun-18 07:53 PM,90% percentile,
Gadget246#0848,25-Jun-18 07:53 PM,i'm awful and never plan to be good so it's not so bad for me,
Samsung#6949,25-Jun-18 07:53 PM,Like legend 5/ancient 1 but I play with archons and divines both and I feel both sides of the spectrum,
Snowfish#4289,25-Jun-18 07:53 PM,"like ""i'll get fucked by any pro player but im better than most of my friends""",
Snowfish#4289,25-Jun-18 07:54 PM,idk the new ranking system,
Gadget246#0848,25-Jun-18 07:54 PM,the best person we play with wasn't even 3k back when mmr was a number,
Snowfish#4289,25-Jun-18 07:54 PM,what is legend 5,
Gadget246#0848,25-Jun-18 07:54 PM,so we're just hanging out in the shit tier,
Samsung#6949,25-Jun-18 07:54 PM,Well I was also like low 4k before,
Samsung#6949,25-Jun-18 07:54 PM,But I stopped playing and didnt really climb so idk what Im really at,
Samsung#6949,25-Jun-18 07:54 PM,Also with mmr seasons added everything got thrown around,
Gadget246#0848,25-Jun-18 07:55 PM,"yeah that sounds really sucky nichole, i'm sorry that happened",
Gadget246#0848,25-Jun-18 07:55 PM,"i g2g run an errand, bbl",

Snowfish#4289,25-Jun-18 08:02 PM,"you could say, a general discussion",
Gadget246#0848,25-Jun-18 08:06 PM,it was a discussion about games in general followed by a brief discussion about one game in particular,
Samsung#6949,25-Jun-18 08:11 PM,Yeah that sort of stuff happens in general all the time,
Samsung#6949,25-Jun-18 08:12 PM,Conversations tend to be pretty dynamic,
Samsung#6949,25-Jun-18 08:12 PM,Like #weeaboos was in here and #housing and #courses always show up,

MKA#5877,25-Jun-18 09:59 PM,*serious question now* my immunization forms are due today and i submitted all of them a while ago and they’re all approved except the one for if you’re under 18. i’m under 18 right now but my birthday is before august. do i still have to do it,
Snowfish#4289,25-Jun-18 10:00 PM,i'd email or call,

MKA#5877,25-Jun-18 10:00 PM,or i can just get my parents to sign it anyway it’s just a permission form basically,
unahb#8581,25-Jun-18 10:00 PM,immunizations is a big joke,
MKA#5877,25-Jun-18 10:00 PM,that would be quicker than calling or emailing,

Inko#4822,25-Jun-18 10:05 PM,that guarantees you have a way out without going through other people's showers,
Inko#4822,25-Jun-18 10:05 PM,and people are nice enough to wait until the two outer showers are unused,
Inko#4822,25-Jun-18 10:06 PM,generally at least,
Inko#4822,25-Jun-18 10:06 PM,there were some peak hours iirc like before 9am classes,

waffle.dynasty#2740,25-Jun-18 11:34 PM,@Gadget246#0848 when I do it it's very similar to an arm dab where the inside of my knee come up in between my eyes. My shoe is up by my ear like my hand would be during an arm dab,

Snowfish#4289,26-Jun-18 12:31 AM,-25?,
Snowfish#4289,26-Jun-18 12:31 AM,how do you go down,
KyotoKoto#5113,26-Jun-18 12:31 AM,well the score goes down- you start at 100,
Snowfish#4289,26-Jun-18 12:31 AM,oh.,
KyotoKoto#5113,26-Jun-18 12:31 AM,"then the more ""promiscuous"" you get, you go down from there",
Snowfish#4289,26-Jun-18 12:31 AM,i know mine is like,

Snowfish#4289,26-Jun-18 12:31 AM,8 away from the lowest,
Snowfish#4289,26-Jun-18 12:31 AM,or something,
KyotoKoto#5113,26-Jun-18 12:31 AM,i think mine is 23 lol,
Chafos#1781,26-Jun-18 12:31 AM,oh the fact that the highest is 100 makes my score so much worse haha,
Snowfish#4289,26-Jun-18 12:31 AM,i havent been arrested and i think like,

Gadget246#0848,26-Jun-18 12:33 AM,losing 25 points at once seems actively difficult,
KyotoKoto#5113,26-Jun-18 12:33 AM,well it's more in a day,
Gadget246#0848,26-Jun-18 12:33 AM,i don't think there are 25 related points,
Snowfish#4289,26-Jun-18 12:33 AM,ah ok,
Gadget246#0848,26-Jun-18 12:33 AM,so you'd have to be doing high point loss activities all throughout the course of a day or something like that,
Snowfish#4289,26-Jun-18 12:33 AM,thats more reasonable,
Snowfish#4289,26-Jun-18 12:33 AM,i mean,

saxon_dr#3806,27-Jun-18 02:02 AM,it was me :thonk:,
suyashr99#7560,27-Jun-18 02:02 AM,I didn't want to make one,
Snowfish#4289,27-Jun-18 02:02 AM,i treid,
Snowfish#4289,27-Jun-18 02:02 AM,make a bot,
Snowfish#4289,27-Jun-18 02:02 AM,that lets you make polls,
Snowfish#4289,27-Jun-18 02:02 AM,and automatically posts the response,
Snowfish#4289,27-Jun-18 02:02 AM,after x amount of time,
suyashr99#7560,27-Jun-18 02:02 AM,But I wanted a bot that autocorrected god to @Snowfish#4289,
Snowfish#4289,27-Jun-18 02:02 AM,:GWnanamiSachiHeart:,
saxon_dr#3806,27-Jun-18 02:02 AM,so how did that go,
Snowfish#4289,27-Jun-18 02:02 AM,i think there is one,
udishab#2211,27-Jun-18 02:02 AM,i'm in favor of that bot,
saxon_dr#3806,27-Jun-18 02:03 AM,so the thing is i don't really have motivation to figure it out cuz every functionality that my peanut brain can come up with apparently already exists in some bot,
Snowfish#4289,27-Jun-18 02:03 AM,who cares,
Snowfish#4289,27-Jun-18 02:03 AM,i want your bot,
Snowfish#4289,27-Jun-18 02:03 AM,:GWnanamiEmiliaLove:,

Snowfish#4289,27-Jun-18 02:06 AM,last boss of the expac on the hardest difficulty tho :GWnanamiRankoSmug:,
saxon_dr#3806,27-Jun-18 02:06 AM,ok making a bot will probably also help me figure out how to use vps cuz i have no idea how to do anything :k3llyLost:,
Snowfish#4289,27-Jun-18 02:06 AM,yay :GWovoYayy:,
Snowfish#4289,27-Jun-18 02:06 AM,idk if theyre overhauling the engine @suyashr99#7560,

Snowfish#4289,27-Jun-18 02:18 AM,ok ok,
Snowfish#4289,27-Jun-18 02:18 AM,im about to go onjto episode 2,
suyashr99#7560,27-Jun-18 02:18 AM,Hyouka is not my favorite anime tho 😔,
Snowfish#4289,27-Jun-18 02:19 AM,i said one of,
suyashr99#7560,27-Jun-18 02:19 AM,That would be either Hxh or rakugo,
Gadget246#0848,27-Jun-18 02:19 AM,if you guys are gonna watch a dubbed anime and non-weebs are allowed to join count me in,
Snowfish#4289,27-Jun-18 02:19 AM,i marathon stuff,
suyashr99#7560,27-Jun-18 02:19 AM,Dubs :OMEGALUL:,
Snowfish#4289,27-Jun-18 02:19 AM,so im really hard to watch waht ive commited to watch with,
Snowfish#4289,27-Jun-18 02:19 AM,i gotta go into something watching it with someone else,
Snowfish#4289,27-Jun-18 02:19 AM,or ill finish it,
Gadget246#0848,27-Jun-18 02:20 AM,the only anime i've ever watched is fairy tail and the dub for fairy tail is terrific so i don't understand why people hate on dubs,
udishab#2211,27-Jun-18 02:20 AM,idk dubs can sound cringe at times,
suyashr99#7560,27-Jun-18 02:20 AM,Because the subs have better voice actors,
Inko#4822,27-Jun-18 02:20 AM,dubs usually come out later and by then you're used to the sub,
MEE6#4876,27-Jun-18 02:20 AM,"GG @Inko#4822, you just advanced to level 10!",
suyashr99#7560,27-Jun-18 02:21 AM,Japanese voice acting is pretty serious,
suyashr99#7560,27-Jun-18 02:21 AM,Those dudes are celebrities,
suyashr99#7560,27-Jun-18 02:21 AM,While here some of struggle to eat,
Gadget246#0848,27-Jun-18 02:22 AM,"idk, i don't like subtitles, whenever i try to watch something with subtitles i end up tunnel visioning on the words and missing a lot of the visuals",
MooshRum#3936,27-Jun-18 02:23 AM,fairy tails dubbed isnt that bad tbh,
suyashr99#7560,27-Jun-18 02:23 AM,I've gotten to peak weaboo,
udishab#2211,27-Jun-18 02:23 AM,one of my favorite dubs is cowboy bebop,
MooshRum#3936,27-Jun-18 02:23 AM,another good one,
suyashr99#7560,27-Jun-18 02:23 AM,I can get the gist meaning of subs through tone and a few words alone,
suyashr99#7560,27-Jun-18 02:24 AM,Fmab is good dub,
MooshRum#3936,27-Jun-18 02:24 AM,thats not peak,
suyashr99#7560,27-Jun-18 02:24 AM,Actually dub better than sub for fmab,
MooshRum#3936,27-Jun-18 02:24 AM,peak is not even needing subs,
MooshRum#3936,27-Jun-18 02:24 AM,"fmab takes place in ""england"" so it makes sense",
suyashr99#7560,27-Jun-18 02:24 AM,Yeah but then that's actually learning Japanese,
MooshRum#3936,27-Jun-18 02:24 AM,Amestria is basically europe,
MooshRum#3936,27-Jun-18 02:24 AM,nah learning it from anime alone,

Inko#4822,28-Jun-18 12:39 AM,the vending machines in the culc are much older than west village and ic,
suyashr99#7560,28-Jun-18 12:39 AM,Buzzcard is your student ID,
suyashr99#7560,28-Jun-18 12:39 AM,You use it to get into places,

Inko#4822,28-Jun-18 12:46 AM,probably more than half of my classes took attendance,
Inko#4822,28-Jun-18 12:46 AM,from 250 person intro calc classes to 15 people english and history classes,
suyashr99#7560,28-Jun-18 12:48 AM,For grade?,
Inko#4822,28-Jun-18 12:50 AM,what,
Inko#4822,28-Jun-18 12:50 AM,why would peopel take attendance just cuz lol,
suyashr99#7560,28-Jun-18 12:50 AM,¯\_(ツ)_/¯,
Inko#4822,28-Jun-18 12:51 AM,it ranges from maybe 5-10% from what I've seen,
Inko#4822,28-Jun-18 12:51 AM,but really its so profs know when to bump someone,
Inko#4822,28-Jun-18 12:58 AM,I take that back,
Inko#4822,28-Jun-18 12:58 AM,I've also seen profs take attendance because the administration needs to know who's attending school,
Inko#4822,28-Jun-18 12:58 AM,for scholarship and legal (visa) related reasons,

bu#7175,28-Jun-18 01:13 AM,Ik its hypocritical for me but I just did this to fit in lol,
Snowfish#4289,28-Jun-18 01:13 AM,what do you mean?,
Snowfish#4289,28-Jun-18 01:14 AM,i use discord mostly for gaming but everyone here knows my real name :),
bu#7175,28-Jun-18 01:14 AM,I cant get on groupme(windows phone) so i thought id try the discord,
bu#7175,28-Jun-18 01:14 AM,I mean this gt discord not discord in general,
suyashr99#7560,28-Jun-18 01:14 AM,You can get on GroupMe on browser,
bu#7175,28-Jun-18 01:14 AM,I use discord for gaming too,
Snowfish#4289,28-Jun-18 01:14 AM,ah that makes sense - groupme requires facebook to link but discord doesn't,
Snowfish#4289,28-Jun-18 01:15 AM,so you don't automatically have your real name tied to it,
bu#7175,28-Jun-18 01:15 AM,that too,
bu#7175,28-Jun-18 01:15 AM,no facebook,
bu#7175,28-Jun-18 01:15 AM,but the anonymity is still a little discerning,
Snowfish#4289,28-Jun-18 01:15 AM,i'm sorry you feel that way,
Snowfish#4289,28-Jun-18 01:15 AM,i know most of the people's real names,

saxon_dr#3806,28-Jun-18 01:59 AM,i don't think that has anything to do with intelligence,
suyashr99#7560,28-Jun-18 01:59 AM,Wait @saxon_dr#3806 you're from China right,

suyashr99#7560,28-Jun-18 02:00 AM,Is discord banned or are you using VPN,

Inko#4822,28-Jun-18 02:01 AM,fyi gatech has a vpn and it works for bypassing great firewall in china,
saxon_dr#3806,28-Jun-18 02:02 AM,oh i have a bunch of them too in case some of them doesn't work :k3llyLUL:,
saxon_dr#3806,28-Jun-18 02:02 AM,as in we get it for free?,
Inko#4822,28-Jun-18 02:02 AM,if you're a current student,
saxon_dr#3806,28-Jun-18 02:02 AM,oh cool,
Inko#4822,28-Jun-18 02:02 AM,"if you guys want to try it out, it's anyc.vpn.gatech.edu",
saxon_dr#3806,28-Jun-18 02:02 AM,ok when this one times out i'll give it a shot,
suyashr99#7560,28-Jun-18 02:03 AM,Yo what,
suyashr99#7560,28-Jun-18 02:03 AM,We get a VPN,
suyashr99#7560,28-Jun-18 02:03 AM,Can that be pinned,
Inko#4822,28-Jun-18 02:03 AM,it already is,
KyotoKoto#5113,28-Jun-18 02:03 AM,why do they give us a vpn?,
KyotoKoto#5113,28-Jun-18 02:03 AM,like what's tech's reasoning?,
Inko#4822,28-Jun-18 02:03 AM,some gatech resources are only available on the campus network,
Inko#4822,28-Jun-18 02:03 AM,for security reasons,
Snowfish#4289,28-Jun-18 02:04 AM,also you can print,
Snowfish#4289,28-Jun-18 02:04 AM,:Pog:,
saxon_dr#3806,28-Jun-18 02:04 AM,:Pog:,
Inko#4822,28-Jun-18 02:04 AM,so if you want to access campus resources from outside campus you need vpn,
suyashr99#7560,28-Jun-18 02:04 AM,Based GT,
Inko#4822,28-Jun-18 02:04 AM,example: ssh ing into CoC computer clusters,
suyashr99#7560,28-Jun-18 02:05 AM,Do your email privledges die after you graduate?,
Inko#4822,28-Jun-18 02:05 AM,2 semesters after you leave I think,
Snowfish#4289,28-Jun-18 02:05 AM,my brother said yes but he probably never even used it,
Snowfish#4289,28-Jun-18 02:05 AM,literally the embodiment of C's get degrees,
Snowfish#4289,28-Jun-18 02:05 AM,god bless,

Inko#4822,28-Jun-18 02:06 AM,rip your brother,
Inko#4822,28-Jun-18 02:07 AM,though a ton of students make 6 figures at billion dollar tech companies,
Inko#4822,28-Jun-18 02:07 AM,I'm sure all you guys could do it if you put in the work 😃,
Snowfish#4289,28-Jun-18 02:07 AM,this is true,
suyashr99#7560,28-Jun-18 02:07 AM,I wonder if you're one of them :Thonk_transparent:,

waffle.dynasty#2740,28-Jun-18 02:08 AM,Inko = Elon musk,

saxon_dr#3806,28-Jun-18 02:13 AM,yeah that's uh,
saxon_dr#3806,28-Jun-18 02:13 AM,weird,
Snowfish#4289,28-Jun-18 02:13 AM,ummm i dont think a guy can talk about what's degrading for females,
Snowfish#4289,28-Jun-18 02:13 AM,lol,
bu#7175,28-Jun-18 02:13 AM,thats just uncomfortabe,
suyashr99#7560,28-Jun-18 02:13 AM,I'm assuming you're coastal?,
saxon_dr#3806,28-Jun-18 02:13 AM,shanghai yes,
bu#7175,28-Jun-18 02:13 AM,uncomfortable*,
saxon_dr#3806,28-Jun-18 02:13 AM,so i'm actually supposed to be in that timezone,
Snowfish#4289,28-Jun-18 02:13 AM,you called it degrading~,
brumeux#4293,28-Jun-18 02:13 AM,that would be weird like whos trying to pull on groupme,
brumeux#4293,28-Jun-18 02:14 AM,oh wait :OMEGALUL:,
bu#7175,28-Jun-18 02:14 AM,I was saying a bikini pic is uncomfortable in a groupme,
Snowfish#4289,28-Jun-18 02:14 AM,you called hentai degrading,
Snowfish#4289,28-Jun-18 02:14 AM,"but  not porn, which involves a real physical human being",
bu#7175,28-Jun-18 02:14 AM,but I think anyone can agree on whats degrading vs not degrading,
Snowfish#4289,28-Jun-18 02:14 AM,okay,
bu#7175,28-Jun-18 02:14 AM,no I said porn also is,
brumeux#4293,28-Jun-18 02:14 AM,"""not to the same extent""",
Snowfish#4289,28-Jun-18 02:14 AM,"but just so you know, you're wrong 😝",
bu#7175,28-Jun-18 02:14 AM,aka still degrading but not to the same extent,
saxon_dr#3806,28-Jun-18 02:14 AM,yeah but especially as a guy your opinion on whether or not it's degrading to girls isn't really important,
Snowfish#4289,28-Jun-18 02:15 AM,"i just dont understand how a drawn image is more exploitive and degrading than a real, physical human being, high out of their minds on drugs being reduced to nothing but a sex object",
bu#7175,28-Jun-18 02:15 AM,"hm I didnt consider it like that, you're right",
brumeux#4293,28-Jun-18 02:15 AM,not to mention how shitty women of color are portrayed,
brumeux#4293,28-Jun-18 02:15 AM,its. very racist a lot of times,
bu#7175,28-Jun-18 02:16 AM,fetizitation is awful yeah,
Snowfish#4289,28-Jun-18 02:16 AM,_colored_ sex objects 😰,
saxon_dr#3806,28-Jun-18 02:16 AM,we were actually talking about this subject in english class this year cuz we were reading handmaid's tale,
brumeux#4293,28-Jun-18 02:16 AM,"""ebony"" 🤢",
saxon_dr#3806,28-Jun-18 02:16 AM,"and one of the things we talked about is that while most porn is really unrealistic and misogynistic, it is the only industry in the united states where women get paid more than men",
saxon_dr#3806,28-Jun-18 02:16 AM,:thonk:,
brumeux#4293,28-Jun-18 02:16 AM,oof,
suyashr99#7560,28-Jun-18 02:16 AM,What about modeling,
Snowfish#4289,28-Jun-18 02:17 AM,male models actually get paid really well,
saxon_dr#3806,28-Jun-18 02:17 AM,oh i think that might be true for modeling too but you can say the same thing about modeling imo,
bu#7175,28-Jun-18 02:17 AM,"just to clarify where I was coming from, I meant how in hentai women are often made as objects even moreso than the alternative, but I guess youre right in the sense that practically real life is worse",
bu#7175,28-Jun-18 02:17 AM,no,
bu#7175,28-Jun-18 02:17 AM,male models get paid awfully,
bu#7175,28-Jun-18 02:17 AM,male modelling is actually horrible to get into,
Snowfish#4289,28-Jun-18 02:17 AM,well so is female modeling,
Snowfish#4289,28-Jun-18 02:17 AM,its a shitshow all around,
bu#7175,28-Jun-18 02:18 AM,both suck but trust me males really get the shaft in modelling,
saxon_dr#3806,28-Jun-18 02:18 AM,"ok one example i just can't even fathom is that, in *The Crown*, a show completely about queen elizabeth, the actor for phillip gets paid more",
saxon_dr#3806,28-Jun-18 02:18 AM,like wat,
brumeux#4293,28-Jun-18 02:18 AM,yeah must suck to have a pay gap,
saxon_dr#3806,28-Jun-18 02:18 AM,that character just derps round flying his plane,
brumeux#4293,28-Jun-18 02:18 AM,in modeling,
suyashr99#7560,28-Jun-18 02:18 AM,That's why I watch game of thrones,
suyashr99#7560,28-Jun-18 02:18 AM,Equal pay,
bu#7175,28-Jun-18 02:18 AM,mom was a model and then managed,
suyashr99#7560,28-Jun-18 02:18 AM,And equal death,
bu#7175,28-Jun-18 02:18 AM,I modeled for a bit,
bu#7175,28-Jun-18 02:18 AM,it sucks,
bu#7175,28-Jun-18 02:18 AM,not all that bad,
brumeux#4293,28-Jun-18 02:18 AM,oh wow a model,
bu#7175,28-Jun-18 02:18 AM,at least my experience but the older dudes hated it,
Snowfish#4289,28-Jun-18 02:19 AM,wow you've done a lot,
saxon_dr#3806,28-Jun-18 02:19 AM,that's cool,
Snowfish#4289,28-Jun-18 02:19 AM,i was talking like higher end models,
Snowfish#4289,28-Jun-18 02:19 AM,i guess in genreal idk,
bu#7175,28-Jun-18 02:19 AM,yeah ofc,
brumeux#4293,28-Jun-18 02:20 AM,"i will say that men can model when theyre way older whereas women are traded out once theyre older than like, 30",
bu#7175,28-Jun-18 02:20 AM,it gets worse the further up you go,
bu#7175,28-Jun-18 02:20 AM,not always,
bu#7175,28-Jun-18 02:20 AM,both men and women have a lot of oppertunities after retierment,
brumeux#4293,28-Jun-18 02:20 AM,retirement?? i mean working,
bu#7175,28-Jun-18 02:20 AM,yes,
brumeux#4293,28-Jun-18 02:20 AM,like. as a model.,
bu#7175,28-Jun-18 02:20 AM,retierment as in when they finish working as a model,
bu#7175,28-Jun-18 02:21 AM,"as in when they get ""traded out""",
bu#7175,28-Jun-18 02:21 AM,they dont actually get traded out,
bu#7175,28-Jun-18 02:21 AM,many work in the industry in other roles,
bu#7175,28-Jun-18 02:21 AM,with males theres a REAL high turnover,
suyashr99#7560,28-Jun-18 02:21 AM,"https://reddit.com/r/Rateme/comments/3sgqzw/m60_retired_but_not_out_giving_a_last_go_to_my/, , This is the top post on rateme",

brumeux#4293,28-Jun-18 02:21 AM,7/10,
bu#7175,28-Jun-18 02:22 AM,"for women theres a lot of space in other related fields, for guys its either continue modelling, finesse your way into a support role, or get fucked lmao",
brumeux#4293,28-Jun-18 02:22 AM,ah i didnt know how it went after models stop modeling,
suyashr99#7560,28-Jun-18 02:22 AM,That sounds like rap,
bu#7175,28-Jun-18 02:23 AM,"lotta women end up managing, makeup, fashion design, producer roles, etc",
brumeux#4293,28-Jun-18 02:23 AM,ah nice,
bu#7175,28-Jun-18 02:25 AM,women do have the larger risk of predatory managers and stuff though which is awful,
Snowfish#4289,28-Jun-18 02:25 AM,so mustafa ive got a question for you,
Snowfish#4289,28-Jun-18 02:25 AM,sorry if im just misunderstanding you here,

Snowfish#4289,28-Jun-18 02:26 AM,but you need to be nicer to the people here,
Snowfish#4289,28-Jun-18 02:27 AM,i don't know if you're trying to start shit or not but you gotta chillax,
bu#7175,28-Jun-18 02:27 AM,"aw my mistake, didn't mean to be rude there",
Snowfish#4289,28-Jun-18 02:27 AM,of course,
bu#7175,28-Jun-18 02:27 AM,meant it as tongue in cheek but it was a dick thing to say,
Snowfish#4289,28-Jun-18 02:27 AM,"well considering you came in here initially talking about us having a lot of alumni, then you keep bringing up the whole anime profile picture stuff?",
Snowfish#4289,28-Jun-18 02:27 AM,"i mean come on man, think before you speak",
Snowfish#4289,28-Jun-18 02:28 AM,no reason to be so hostile,
Snowfish#4289,28-Jun-18 02:28 AM,:(,
brumeux#4293,28-Jun-18 02:28 AM,kinda hostile dude :/,

Snowfish#4289,28-Jun-18 02:54 AM,not as far as i know,
Gadget246#0848,28-Jun-18 02:55 AM,"idk, maybe i'm just having a hard time following it, but there seemed to be large gaps in the conversation, i think i was able to fill them in on context tho",

KyotoKoto#5113,28-Jun-18 03:44 AM,maybe it's how frequently you message?,
Lennox#3038,28-Jun-18 03:44 AM,ranks work by a combination of rng and spacing out messages correctly,
Snowfish#4289,28-Jun-18 03:44 AM,no,
Snowfish#4289,28-Jun-18 03:44 AM,mee6 gives you random 15-25 xp every minute,

suyashr99#7560,28-Jun-18 03:45 AM,Nice to confirm,
KyotoKoto#5113,28-Jun-18 03:47 AM,I've sent the least number of messages it seems :thonkig: maybe I've just sent a lot in a fairly short amount of time since I only started actively participating in chat fairly recently,
ratarafu#1603,28-Jun-18 03:47 AM,We low ranked plebs not even in the rankings smh,
suyashr99#7560,28-Jun-18 03:47 AM,@KyotoKoto#5113 did we become active around the same time?,

suyashr99#7560,28-Jun-18 03:48 AM,But its actually more like a week,
KyotoKoto#5113,28-Jun-18 03:49 AM,"I don't know lol, , I joined the same day that EA decisions came out, participated a little bit then just muted the discord and forgot about it for a bit, , then I revisited again maybe for a couple of weeks? idk I'm really bad at estimating etas",
Snowfish#4289,28-Jun-18 03:49 AM,aint it,
suyashr99#7560,28-Jun-18 03:50 AM,Lol I did the same thing,
suyashr99#7560,28-Jun-18 03:50 AM,But now I'm stuck here,
waffle.dynasty#2740,28-Jun-18 03:50 AM,I was active after  EA but then didn't pay much attention March-May because of school,
waffle.dynasty#2740,28-Jun-18 03:51 AM,I'm only active now because I sleep from like 6am to 3pm,
Snowfish#4289,28-Jun-18 03:51 AM,someone linked this discord in the esports channel and was like,
Snowfish#4289,28-Jun-18 03:51 AM,"""go say hi to the freshman""",
Snowfish#4289,28-Jun-18 03:51 AM,then you guys needed all this help,
Snowfish#4289,28-Jun-18 03:51 AM,and now im chained here,
waffle.dynasty#2740,28-Jun-18 03:51 AM,During the school year I would go to bed around 11 or 12 so i'd miss all the activity,
brumeux#4293,28-Jun-18 03:54 AM,this is ludicrously late for me to be up tbh,
brumeux#4293,28-Jun-18 03:55 AM,sleep did not happen at faset so its been a while,
Snowfish#4289,28-Jun-18 03:56 AM,go to sleep,

Gadget246#0848,28-Jun-18 04:27 AM,"one thing to note that probably isn't particularly relevant for anyone but me is that i tend to make new lines in my message instead of sending multiple messages at once, so my # of messages sent is a little bit deflated.",

saxon_dr#3806,28-Jun-18 09:40 AM,it actually doesn't happen that often,
MKA#5877,28-Jun-18 10:26 AM,i woke up before my alarm for school about 3 times all of high school,
MKA#5877,28-Jun-18 10:27 AM,i never slept through it but sometimes i fell asleep again after it went off haha,
udishab#2211,28-Jun-18 10:28 AM,"one time i slept past all my alarms and realized i missed my first class when i woke up, said eh screw it, and went back to sleep",

bopas2#1774,28-Jun-18 10:52 AM,my friend slept through the AP psych exam lol,
bopas2#1774,28-Jun-18 10:52 AM,partly to spite Rice for not letting him drop the class,
bopas2#1774,28-Jun-18 10:53 AM,partly because he slept too long,
udishab#2211,28-Jun-18 10:57 AM,yikes id freak out if i woke up and realized i missed an ap exam,
MKA#5877,28-Jun-18 10:59 AM,i would too if it were an ap exam i cared about,
MKA#5877,28-Jun-18 10:59 AM,like lit this year? nah don’t care already got credit from lang,
saxon_dr#3806,28-Jun-18 11:01 AM,lol this one senior two years ago before the physics c was like,
saxon_dr#3806,28-Jun-18 11:02 AM,nah fk it i'm not gonna get a 5,
saxon_dr#3806,28-Jun-18 11:02 AM,i'm just gonna stay in and play games,
MKA#5877,28-Jun-18 11:03 AM,i took the ap test for physics c without taking the course,
MKA#5877,28-Jun-18 11:03 AM,i took physics 1 and IB physics HL tho so I knew most of the stuff already just needed to add calculus and also like half of E&M,
saxon_dr#3806,28-Jun-18 11:03 AM,how'd it go,
MKA#5877,28-Jun-18 11:03 AM,i didn’t think I was gonna get a 5 for credit but thought well might as well try ¯\_(ツ)_/¯,
MKA#5877,28-Jun-18 11:04 AM,idk i would say 4 on mech and like a 2 on E&M man I knew how to do like half of it at best probably less,
saxon_dr#3806,28-Jun-18 11:04 AM,are you gonna take the placement test for uh w/e that course is called if you get a 4,
saxon_dr#3806,28-Jun-18 11:04 AM,phys 1211?,
MKA#5877,28-Jun-18 11:05 AM,probably not,
MKA#5877,28-Jun-18 11:06 AM,i also could get credit from IB Physics (both 2211 and 2212) so we’ll see from that,

bopas2#1774,28-Jun-18 11:32 AM,I had an intro to engineering class where we fucked around with projects which was very entertaining,
saxon_dr#3806,28-Jun-18 11:32 AM,oh we did that too but,
saxon_dr#3806,28-Jun-18 11:32 AM,i just felt like i had more experience than most of the kids in that class so it wasn't particularly fun,
saxon_dr#3806,28-Jun-18 11:32 AM,but i got to use 3d printers and laser cutters so that's cool i guess,

saxon_dr#3806,28-Jun-18 11:34 AM,are they like those parents that actually know what the classes you're taking are?,
saxon_dr#3806,28-Jun-18 11:35 AM,cuz my parents have no clue wtf i'm doing if i don't tell them,

Inko#4822,28-Jun-18 11:35 AM,lol you have cs major tag,

Inko#4822,28-Jun-18 11:36 AM,well i guess you need an understanding of electricity for EE,
saxon_dr#3806,28-Jun-18 11:36 AM,"just tell your parents ""i can't fail the future phys classes if i don't even take them to start with <a:weSmart:394000368318676992> """,

Snowfish#4289,28-Jun-18 03:12 PM,the 100 is with legion,

suyashr99#7560,28-Jun-18 03:23 PM,Some orthogonality,
Quantum#1480,28-Jun-18 03:23 PM,Yeah up through eigenvectors and svd,
suyashr99#7560,28-Jun-18 03:23 PM,And using gram Schmidt to orthogonalize bases,
suyashr99#7560,28-Jun-18 03:23 PM,Oh,
efank#9753,28-Jun-18 03:23 PM,hmm ok,

suyashr99#7560,28-Jun-18 03:23 PM,Google matrix is fun,
efank#9753,28-Jun-18 03:23 PM,wait,
suyashr99#7560,28-Jun-18 03:23 PM,That's linear,
efank#9753,28-Jun-18 03:24 PM,ah ok,
efank#9753,28-Jun-18 03:24 PM,wait how do you do it w/o proofs,
efank#9753,28-Jun-18 03:24 PM,like were there,
suyashr99#7560,28-Jun-18 03:24 PM,You do math,
efank#9753,28-Jun-18 03:24 PM,linear transformations,
suyashr99#7560,28-Jun-18 03:24 PM,Yeah,
Quantum#1480,28-Jun-18 03:24 PM,Well proofs aren't tested,
efank#9753,28-Jun-18 03:24 PM,ah ok,
Quantum#1480,28-Jun-18 03:24 PM,You can use them for intuition though,
efank#9753,28-Jun-18 03:24 PM,did you have to do matrix manipulation,
suyashr99#7560,28-Jun-18 03:24 PM,Uh,
suyashr99#7560,28-Jun-18 03:25 PM,Yeah,
unahb#8581,28-Jun-18 03:25 PM,this sounds like scary stuff,
suyashr99#7560,28-Jun-18 03:25 PM,Svd,
suyashr99#7560,28-Jun-18 03:25 PM,And decomposition,
suyashr99#7560,28-Jun-18 03:25 PM,Uh matrices inside matrices,
suyashr99#7560,28-Jun-18 03:25 PM,Similar matrices,
efank#9753,28-Jun-18 03:25 PM,how about,
efank#9753,28-Jun-18 03:25 PM,dual spaces,
suyashr99#7560,28-Jun-18 03:25 PM,@Quantum#1480 what was that thing where if you flip the matrix around,
efank#9753,28-Jun-18 03:25 PM,and quotient spaces?,
efank#9753,28-Jun-18 03:26 PM,Transpose,
suyashr99#7560,28-Jun-18 03:26 PM,Something to do with transpose,
efank#9753,28-Jun-18 03:26 PM,that's the dual map,
suyashr99#7560,28-Jun-18 03:26 PM,ATA,

efank#9753,28-Jun-18 03:30 PM,no i dont know any linear algebra till the summer lol,
Quantum#1480,28-Jun-18 03:30 PM,It seems like a good first proof class,
efank#9753,28-Jun-18 03:30 PM,i started studying it this summer,
Quantum#1480,28-Jun-18 03:30 PM,I kinda wish we'd done the proof based version,
8726andrew#5709,28-Jun-18 03:30 PM,( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°),
efank#9753,28-Jun-18 03:31 PM,i'm reading off of a proof-based edition,
efank#9753,28-Jun-18 03:31 PM,though,
suyashr99#7560,28-Jun-18 03:31 PM,That's probably good,
suyashr99#7560,28-Jun-18 03:31 PM,Because you probably need the proof stuff for math major,
suyashr99#7560,28-Jun-18 03:31 PM,Engineers and some CS don't so they kinda skimp it,

8726andrew#5709,28-Jun-18 03:37 PM,Some people in my multi recitations asked like dumb as shit questions and everyone hated them bc they just wasted time,
8726andrew#5709,28-Jun-18 03:37 PM,Like they’d ask something our ta just explained or some question that made literally no sense,
suyashr99#7560,28-Jun-18 03:38 PM,Our ta was useless,

joazlazer#2041,28-Jun-18 05:27 PM,i just dont get summer session,
suyashr99#7560,28-Jun-18 05:27 PM,What about it,
joazlazer#2041,28-Jun-18 05:27 PM,if it is in the same vein as conditional acceptance,
joazlazer#2041,28-Jun-18 05:27 PM,i.e. theyre inconfident in certain admits,
suyashr99#7560,28-Jun-18 05:27 PM,It's a tier above,
joazlazer#2041,28-Jun-18 05:27 PM,so they send them to summer,
joazlazer#2041,28-Jun-18 05:27 PM,it doesnt make sense,
joazlazer#2041,28-Jun-18 05:27 PM,because then they give us gpa boosters,
joazlazer#2041,28-Jun-18 05:28 PM,classes that are so easy anyone could pass them,
suyashr99#7560,28-Jun-18 05:28 PM,Have you met a Sydney kaltman,

joazlazer#2041,28-Jun-18 05:28 PM,rockets that run on gpa?,
waffle.dynasty#2740,28-Jun-18 05:28 PM,I thought summer session was for good student who are coming in with very few credits,
suyashr99#7560,28-Jun-18 05:28 PM,I think the idea is,
suyashr99#7560,28-Jun-18 05:28 PM,That,
suyashr99#7560,28-Jun-18 05:28 PM,And,
thedragonlegacy#2854,28-Jun-18 05:28 PM,no... and i'd rather not say :p,
joazlazer#2041,28-Jun-18 05:28 PM,I have like 26 credits @waffle.dynasty#2740,
joazlazer#2041,28-Jun-18 05:29 PM,I feel like it might be a sort of yield protection,
suyashr99#7560,28-Jun-18 05:29 PM,They want to predispose you to college environment?,
suyashr99#7560,28-Jun-18 05:29 PM,And just the way it is ?,
joazlazer#2041,28-Jun-18 05:29 PM,like not in the dumb r/a2c thing,
joazlazer#2041,28-Jun-18 05:29 PM,but like,
joazlazer#2041,28-Jun-18 05:29 PM,people theyre not confident that we'll actually attend,
joazlazer#2041,28-Jun-18 05:29 PM,so they admit us in summer,
joazlazer#2041,28-Jun-18 05:29 PM,so were not included in their fall stats,
suyashr99#7560,28-Jun-18 05:29 PM,Ya,
joazlazer#2041,28-Jun-18 05:29 PM,either that or its just random,
suyashr99#7560,28-Jun-18 05:30 PM,I don't think it's random,
suyashr99#7560,28-Jun-18 05:30 PM,The lady who came to our school,
suyashr99#7560,28-Jun-18 05:30 PM,Said they use it as a way to accept more students then they technically can,
joazlazer#2041,28-Jun-18 05:30 PM,but that doesn't make sense,
suyashr99#7560,28-Jun-18 05:30 PM,And I guess the classes are fucking easy because statistically those are the classes that a lot of freshman are in?,
joazlazer#2041,28-Jun-18 05:30 PM,we'll just go into the fall class like normal,
joazlazer#2041,28-Jun-18 05:31 PM,theyre just slightly reducing gen ed class sizes,
joazlazer#2041,28-Jun-18 05:31 PM,very slightly,
joazlazer#2041,28-Jun-18 05:31 PM,but we'll still take up housing,
suyashr99#7560,28-Jun-18 05:32 PM,GT works in mysterious ways,
brumeux#4293,28-Jun-18 05:32 PM,do you live in the same dorms youll be in for fall semester?,
joazlazer#2041,28-Jun-18 05:32 PM,:moon2SHRUG:,
joazlazer#2041,28-Jun-18 05:32 PM,i mean no,
joazlazer#2041,28-Jun-18 05:32 PM,not the same dorms,
joazlazer#2041,28-Jun-18 05:32 PM,iirc we live in LLC dorms,
joazlazer#2041,28-Jun-18 05:32 PM,Folk & Caldwell,
joazlazer#2041,28-Jun-18 05:32 PM,so theyll be full in the fall,

suyashr99#7560,28-Jun-18 06:31 PM,So 4 Max per day,
suyashr99#7560,28-Jun-18 06:31 PM,And that's the meal plan?,
Nobo#2748,28-Jun-18 06:31 PM,it's nerfed,
waffle.dynasty#2740,28-Jun-18 06:32 PM,So no saving up swipes to buy tons of bananas at the end of the semester :PepeHands:,
suyashr99#7560,28-Jun-18 06:32 PM,I was gonna buy water,
Nobo#2748,28-Jun-18 06:32 PM,yeah they nerfed it,
suyashr99#7560,28-Jun-18 06:32 PM,Is gt kill?,
8726andrew#5709,28-Jun-18 06:32 PM,That’s lame as hell wtf,
suyashr99#7560,28-Jun-18 06:33 PM,That meal plan is way over priced then,
Nobo#2748,28-Jun-18 06:33 PM,it is,
thedragonlegacy#2854,28-Jun-18 06:33 PM,yep,
Nobo#2748,28-Jun-18 06:33 PM,dining dollars is by far still 100% the best option after your first year,
suyashr99#7560,28-Jun-18 06:33 PM,Practice on getting fucked in the ass by life I guess,
thedragonlegacy#2854,28-Jun-18 06:33 PM,soph and i calculated it to be $24 per day,
Nobo#2748,28-Jun-18 06:33 PM,"because I know that it's encouraged to go freshman experience or whatever they call it now, but like",
Nobo#2748,28-Jun-18 06:33 PM,after the first semester you'll know,
Nobo#2748,28-Jun-18 06:34 PM,also Dining dollars work ez pz on food trucks and the student center,
Nobo#2748,28-Jun-18 06:34 PM,so much better,
waffle.dynasty#2740,28-Jun-18 06:34 PM,Swipes are worth $10 I thought?,
suyashr99#7560,28-Jun-18 06:34 PM,Artificially,
Nobo#2748,28-Jun-18 06:34 PM,its really perspective here,
Nobo#2748,28-Jun-18 06:34 PM,because then you realize,
suyashr99#7560,28-Jun-18 06:34 PM,At wv they're 10,
Nobo#2748,28-Jun-18 06:34 PM,for $10 at West Village you get,

Nobo#2748,28-Jun-18 06:35 PM,breakfast 100% ripoff,
thedragonlegacy#2854,28-Jun-18 06:35 PM,"they are worth $10 dollars, but $2517 (meal plan cost)/(7 days week * 15 weeks) = $24",
suyashr99#7560,28-Jun-18 06:35 PM,Is breakfast better in a dining hall,
8726andrew#5709,28-Jun-18 06:35 PM,Is the 5 day one any better,
Nobo#2748,28-Jun-18 06:35 PM,*flashbacks to half-filled bowls of food that cost 8 dollars*,

8726andrew#5709,28-Jun-18 06:37 PM,Breakfast is great though why would you stop,
Nobo#2748,28-Jun-18 06:37 PM,yeah admin abuse :PepeHands:,
Nobo#2748,28-Jun-18 06:37 PM,Breakfast was great,
Nobo#2748,28-Jun-18 06:37 PM,until you find yourself going to sleep between 1-3AM,
Nobo#2748,28-Jun-18 06:38 PM,and waking up 10-15 before your first class,
Nobo#2748,28-Jun-18 06:38 PM,which may or may not (if you're unluckers) be at 8 or 9 AM,
waffle.dynasty#2740,28-Jun-18 06:38 PM,Me already,
8726andrew#5709,28-Jun-18 06:38 PM,That’s an easy problem to solve tho,
Nobo#2748,28-Jun-18 06:38 PM,legit most people I know eventually just drank like,
Nobo#2748,28-Jun-18 06:38 PM,a smoothie,
Nobo#2748,28-Jun-18 06:38 PM,or snack bars,
8726andrew#5709,28-Jun-18 06:38 PM,Well going to bed earlier isn’t always an option,
Nobo#2748,28-Jun-18 06:38 PM,quick cereal and go,
thedragonlegacy#2854,28-Jun-18 06:38 PM,@Nobo#2748 hey is the $2517 for the meal plan taxed already? will it be taxed?,
8726andrew#5709,28-Jun-18 06:38 PM,But like you eat a snack before and actual breakfast after,
Nobo#2748,28-Jun-18 06:38 PM,uhhhh,
Nobo#2748,28-Jun-18 06:39 PM,ignore tax,
Nobo#2748,28-Jun-18 06:39 PM,assume its included,
suyashr99#7560,28-Jun-18 06:39 PM,@8726andrew#5709 they usually won't have food after,
thedragonlegacy#2854,28-Jun-18 06:39 PM,okay thanks,
Nobo#2748,28-Jun-18 06:39 PM,as in the price it says is what u pay,
suyashr99#7560,28-Jun-18 06:39 PM,Depending on the time,
Nobo#2748,28-Jun-18 06:39 PM,unless u pay with credit card,
Nobo#2748,28-Jun-18 06:39 PM,then they beat you up and make u pay their third-party vendor a % as fake tax,
8726andrew#5709,28-Jun-18 06:39 PM,I’m assuming you have like an 8 am,
Nobo#2748,28-Jun-18 06:39 PM,like once or twice,
Nobo#2748,28-Jun-18 06:40 PM,TBH every semester is different for me,
Nobo#2748,28-Jun-18 06:40 PM,some semesters i scheduled it up where my first class wasnt until like 11 or noon,
Nobo#2748,28-Jun-18 06:40 PM,and then i'd just wake up a bit before and just eat lunch,
Nobo#2748,28-Jun-18 06:40 PM,other times I would have like,

joazlazer#2041,28-Jun-18 07:46 PM,because theres like nobody from them,
joazlazer#2041,28-Jun-18 07:46 PM,in the discord,
8726andrew#5709,28-Jun-18 07:46 PM,Cs is active bc there’s 80 of yall,
thedragonlegacy#2854,28-Jun-18 07:46 PM,"there's no guarantee that they'll actually be active once we get to GT. I don't expect ppl to be using discord when they have IRL ppl to actually talk to. And if there's a need for it in the fall, it'll be made. chill fam.",
8726andrew#5709,28-Jun-18 07:47 PM,I’m just saying this is some elitism going on here,
waffle.dynasty#2740,28-Jun-18 07:47 PM,I only use the main channels lol,
8726andrew#5709,28-Jun-18 07:47 PM,The cs majors are all totally okay with it :Thonk_transparent:,
Chafos#1781,28-Jun-18 07:47 PM,#math didnt deserve to die like this,
Chafos#1781,28-Jun-18 07:47 PM,im not,
Chafos#1781,28-Jun-18 07:47 PM,you engineering bois should get your chats too,
8726andrew#5709,28-Jun-18 07:48 PM,I never had one in the first place so idk why I really care,
Chafos#1781,28-Jun-18 07:51 PM,tbh tho it probably is a good idea to start cutting down on the number of channels lol,
thedragonlegacy#2854,28-Jun-18 07:51 PM,The server is messy. I'm cleaning it up. What extra benefit will be received by so many chats?,
8726andrew#5709,28-Jun-18 07:51 PM,It’s not like anyone besides the major relevant people saw them tho,
Lennox#3038,28-Jun-18 07:51 PM,I agree with chafos,
Lennox#3038,28-Jun-18 07:51 PM,clean chats are happy chats,
thedragonlegacy#2854,28-Jun-18 07:51 PM,I don't understand why you want to keep so many channels in which no one uses,
8726andrew#5709,28-Jun-18 07:52 PM,Because I didn’t know they existed and now they’ve been snuffed out without a chance to defend themselves,
Chafos#1781,28-Jun-18 07:52 PM,"we should cut #rules, it only has 5 messages /s",
thedragonlegacy#2854,28-Jun-18 07:53 PM,"Sorry, I'm not the one who created them.",
8726andrew#5709,28-Jun-18 07:53 PM,We should cut #general because why not,
brumeux#4293,28-Jun-18 08:14 PM,extra channels are pretty good for having different conversations but theyre not being used so it just makes the discord look barren imo,
brumeux#4293,28-Jun-18 08:14 PM,cut the dead weight:blobhammer:,
8726andrew#5709,28-Jun-18 08:15 PM,"the way marissa changed it is fine, i thought they were just getting hard deleted",
8726andrew#5709,28-Jun-18 08:15 PM,and again you only saw the channel for your major so its not like anyone except admins knew about the others,
8726andrew#5709,28-Jun-18 08:15 PM,hence me not having one lol,
8726andrew#5709,28-Jun-18 08:16 PM,some channels are like not used at all,
brumeux#4293,28-Jun-18 08:16 PM,im the only one whos ever said anything in the bio channel :FeelsBadMan:,
8726andrew#5709,28-Jun-18 08:16 PM,like no offense but <#415710885194235914> has almost really never had anyone talk in it,
8726andrew#5709,28-Jun-18 08:17 PM,rip,

Chafos#1781,28-Jun-18 08:17 PM,well that's one way to do it,
8726andrew#5709,28-Jun-18 08:17 PM,idk what deep talk and intellectual musings are even really for tbh,
8726andrew#5709,28-Jun-18 08:18 PM,but they're there,
Chafos#1781,28-Jun-18 08:18 PM,well we had genuine philosophical discussions a while back,
Lennox#3038,28-Jun-18 08:18 PM,they're for deep talk and intellectual musings,
waffle.dynasty#2740,28-Jun-18 08:18 PM,I think those were to combat spam,
Chafos#1781,28-Jun-18 08:18 PM,but half of the time people go in there and meme now so it's much less genuine,
waffle.dynasty#2740,28-Jun-18 08:18 PM,But now we just spam #general,
8726andrew#5709,28-Jun-18 08:18 PM,#memes needs more memes,
8726andrew#5709,28-Jun-18 08:19 PM,meetups was dead but then faset happened,
8726andrew#5709,28-Jun-18 08:19 PM,study buddies was only really used during ap death times,
waffle.dynasty#2740,28-Jun-18 08:20 PM,^,
Lennox#3038,28-Jun-18 08:20 PM,I'm thinking we should put the fate of these channels to a vote,
8726andrew#5709,28-Jun-18 08:20 PM,half the game channels the only messages are from patchbot,
brumeux#4293,28-Jun-18 08:21 PM,"elimination of inactive channels, reality tv show style",
waffle.dynasty#2740,28-Jun-18 08:21 PM,"""The island has voted""",
8726andrew#5709,28-Jun-18 08:22 PM,we should delete #weeaboos theres nothing of value there /s,

Chafos#1781,28-Jun-18 08:22 PM,ugh we don't need both #musings and <#432961610756390912> but there's a good amount of stuff in each so idk,

8726andrew#5709,28-Jun-18 08:23 PM,hey leave some of gaming alone,
Lennox#3038,28-Jun-18 08:23 PM,or remove from this list,
8726andrew#5709,28-Jun-18 08:23 PM,minecraft gets use,
Chafos#1781,28-Jun-18 08:23 PM,are you gonna link an actual poll or how are we doing this,
brumeux#4293,28-Jun-18 08:23 PM,oh and if anyone's concerned about deleting lgbtq just @ me for the snapchat group,
Lennox#3038,28-Jun-18 08:23 PM,yeah I will (make a poll),
brumeux#4293,28-Jun-18 08:24 PM,it's way more active,
8726andrew#5709,28-Jun-18 08:24 PM,league sorta gets some use,
8726andrew#5709,28-Jun-18 08:24 PM,yeah thats about it,
Lennox#3038,28-Jun-18 08:24 PM,yeah I think #minecraft should be saved since we have a server,
Lennox#3038,28-Jun-18 08:25 PM,any other channels?,
Chafos#1781,28-Jun-18 08:25 PM,was #card-games really used that much?,
8726andrew#5709,28-Jun-18 08:25 PM,the only other channel i saw getting much use was #league-of-legends,
Chafos#1781,28-Jun-18 08:25 PM,i cant really tell but dont want to call for its deletion if others want to keep it,
waffle.dynasty#2740,28-Jun-18 08:26 PM,You know what channels need to be used more often?,
Lennox#3038,28-Jun-18 08:26 PM,Housing is probably unnecessary at this point too,
waffle.dynasty#2740,28-Jun-18 08:26 PM,The voice channels,
Chafos#1781,28-Jun-18 08:26 PM,#csgo was more or less not used,
8726andrew#5709,28-Jun-18 08:26 PM,we can keep housing until school like starts,
waffle.dynasty#2740,28-Jun-18 08:26 PM,Housing has been getting some use,
Chafos#1781,28-Jun-18 08:27 PM,#dota and #dnd were both used a good amount,
waffle.dynasty#2740,28-Jun-18 08:27 PM,I feel like this is a good time to move from an admitted students discord to a students discord,
Chafos#1781,28-Jun-18 08:27 PM,WoW,
waffle.dynasty#2740,28-Jun-18 08:27 PM,When school starts we'll have needs for new channels,
Chafos#1781,28-Jun-18 08:27 PM,what a cultural transition,
waffle.dynasty#2740,28-Jun-18 08:28 PM,Meetups will probably explode once we're all on campus,
Chafos#1781,28-Jun-18 08:28 PM,true,

Lennox#3038,28-Jun-18 08:30 PM,vote for the fate of your favorite channels,
brumeux#4293,28-Jun-18 08:30 PM,"deleting a channel gets rid of its archives/history, correct?",
Lennox#3038,28-Jun-18 08:30 PM,Yes,
Chafos#1781,28-Jun-18 08:31 PM,what is meant by consolidate for #musings and <#432961610756390912>,
brumeux#4293,28-Jun-18 08:31 PM,gotcha 👍 something for people to consider when voting,
Lennox#3038,28-Jun-18 08:31 PM,I imagine just choose one and make that the dedicated channel,
Chafos#1781,28-Jun-18 08:31 PM,huh ok no transfer of messages tho ig,
Lennox#3038,28-Jun-18 08:33 PM,not realistically,
Chafos#1781,28-Jun-18 08:35 PM,"ok so i looked through them and it seems like #musings was the one with the much, much longer history but <#432961610756390912> was actually used for its main purpose more often despite its comparatively much shorter history",
Chafos#1781,28-Jun-18 08:35 PM,so i'd advocate for keeping #musings,
Chafos#1781,28-Jun-18 08:36 PM,just because it was used a lot more,
mic#7575,28-Jun-18 08:36 PM,^,
waffle.dynasty#2740,28-Jun-18 08:36 PM,I agree,
Lennox#3038,28-Jun-18 08:38 PM,we'll need a real admin to come in and actually do this stuff,
Lennox#3038,28-Jun-18 08:39 PM,but the poll can simmer in the meantime,

Also, purging the major chats was warranted tbh, the CE and EE ones literally had like 10 messages, they weren't being used so good riddance.",
waffle.dynasty#2740,28-Jun-18 09:23 PM,The ae chat hadn't been used since January lol,

8726andrew#5709,28-Jun-18 09:24 PM,the lgbt chat was only used like a few times ever and half of them were the low effort troll who got the chat made,
Cole#0059,28-Jun-18 09:25 PM,theres an AE chat?,
Gadget246#0848,28-Jun-18 09:25 PM,my major chat was literally just me and mods feelsbadman,
Snowfish#4289,28-Jun-18 09:25 PM,i recommend getting a lot of cheap groceries because that's the cheapest option for eating,
Snowfish#4289,28-Jun-18 09:25 PM,$1000 for 4 months of food is fucking ridiculous,
Snowfish#4289,28-Jun-18 09:26 PM,i feed 2 people and spend less than $250/mo on groceries and we buy pretty good quality food,
Gadget246#0848,28-Jun-18 09:26 PM,card games is never used and only existed cause i was hoping to find other people who played the same card games i did so i'm fine with that one going away,
Snowfish#4289,28-Jun-18 09:27 PM,honestly,
Snowfish#4289,28-Jun-18 09:27 PM,just destroy all of gaming,
Snowfish#4289,28-Jun-18 09:27 PM,and replace it with just general-gaems,
8726andrew#5709,28-Jun-18 09:27 PM,bruh,
8726andrew#5709,28-Jun-18 09:27 PM,we actually use #minecraft,
Snowfish#4289,28-Jun-18 09:27 PM,oh,
bopas2#1774,28-Jun-18 09:27 PM,"I think the main problem with the lgbt chat is that it is public to everyone in the discord...for many people, at least for me, that part of an identity can be super sensitive and having it open for anyone to lurk dissuades people from talking imo. maybe we make it a optional joinable chat. idk.",

Gadget246#0848,28-Jun-18 10:25 PM,there's no reason for forwarding emails to remove the sending emails functionality,
suyashr99#7560,28-Jun-18 10:25 PM,well,
8726andrew#5709,28-Jun-18 10:25 PM,its policy for them to not be allowed to respond to personal emails,
suyashr99#7560,28-Jun-18 10:25 PM,thats how forwarding emails works,
8726andrew#5709,28-Jun-18 10:25 PM,like it has to be a gt email,

sony#1234,29-Jun-18 12:36 AM,The point of the class is to teach you,
sony#1234,29-Jun-18 12:36 AM,Though you may have a prof that uses a different book,
sony#1234,29-Jun-18 12:36 AM,But in that case it's easier,

sony#1234,29-Jun-18 12:37 AM,Your advisor will tell you,
sony#1234,29-Jun-18 12:37 AM,But likely no,
Snowfish#4289,29-Jun-18 12:37 AM,i'd go in anticipating it to not count,
Snowfish#4289,29-Jun-18 12:37 AM,since tech is usually C+,
unahb#8581,29-Jun-18 12:37 AM,yeah i mean id rather take it again,
Snowfish#4289,29-Jun-18 12:37 AM,especially cs,

nthistle#9117,29-Jun-18 12:38 AM,for cs it's not listed as one of the classes that needs a C or higher,
sony#1234,29-Jun-18 12:38 AM,CS takes a condensed multi class that's only 2hrs,
nthistle#9117,29-Jun-18 12:38 AM,but idk if you could get transfer credit,

Snowfish#4289,29-Jun-18 12:42 AM,but don't take sysarch unless you really like it,
Snowfish#4289,29-Jun-18 12:42 AM,since it was honestly melting my brain,
sony#1234,29-Jun-18 12:42 AM,I mean you can always decide between sys arch and info,
sony#1234,29-Jun-18 12:42 AM,Up till 2200,
sony#1234,29-Jun-18 12:42 AM,Which should give you a good idea about which thread you want to do,
Snowfish#4289,29-Jun-18 12:42 AM,you can decide between a lot of threads,
sony#1234,29-Jun-18 12:42 AM,And then in 2110 you can decide between like all of them,
Snowfish#4289,29-Jun-18 12:43 AM,i had some really fucked credits coming in so i had to make a decision pretty quickly,
sony#1234,29-Jun-18 12:43 AM,If you really hate 2110 don't do sys arch lul,

nthistle#9117,29-Jun-18 12:43 AM,dang,
Snowfish#4289,29-Jun-18 12:43 AM,honestly i think its actually worse to come in with too many credits,
sony#1234,29-Jun-18 12:44 AM,You'll have to decide if you like math at it's worse :monkaS:,
Snowfish#4289,29-Jun-18 12:44 AM,if you have no core classes left to take you kinda get fucked,

suyashr99#7560,29-Jun-18 12:09 PM,What a small world,

suyashr99#7560,29-Jun-18 12:38 PM,Go to passport.gatech.edu,
suyashr99#7560,29-Jun-18 12:38 PM,And create a mailbox,
aquajet#7800,29-Jun-18 12:39 PM,I did that already,
aquajet#7800,29-Jun-18 12:39 PM,"It has 'A Georgia Tech Office 365 mailbox"" checked",
suyashr99#7560,29-Jun-18 12:39 PM,It takes some time I think,
suyashr99#7560,29-Jun-18 12:40 PM,Try again in some,
aquajet#7800,29-Jun-18 12:40 PM,"cool, thanks",
ratarafu#1603,29-Jun-18 12:40 PM,"I can email using my gatech email address without creating a mailbox, right?",
suyashr99#7560,29-Jun-18 12:40 PM,No,
suyashr99#7560,29-Jun-18 12:41 PM,You'd have to set up your own server,
8726andrew#5709,29-Jun-18 12:41 PM,The official response is no from gt,
8726andrew#5709,29-Jun-18 12:41 PM,But there’s a way around it supposedly,
ratarafu#1603,29-Jun-18 12:41 PM,So I should create a mailbox and then forward the emails?,
8726andrew#5709,29-Jun-18 12:42 PM,If you can make that work somehow,
8726andrew#5709,29-Jun-18 12:42 PM,Gt only does one or the other,
8726andrew#5709,29-Jun-18 12:42 PM,I just check the mailbox occasionally,
efank#9753,29-Jun-18 01:03 PM,wdym isn't it w/ the other mailbox you can only receive,
suyashr99#7560,29-Jun-18 01:04 PM,Yeah,
ratarafu#1603,29-Jun-18 01:09 PM,Why isn't everyone allowed to store and forward?,https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/402517390669381633/462303631887040512/Capture.JPG
saxon_dr#3806,29-Jun-18 01:33 PM,hmm that is kinda weird,
sony#1234,29-Jun-18 01:52 PM,@ratarafu#1603 because then they cant nuke your mailbox,
sony#1234,29-Jun-18 01:53 PM,like research information. they dont really want you to keep that privately,
sony#1234,29-Jun-18 01:53 PM,of course you can save it and whatever but they just dont want you to 🤷,
ratarafu#1603,29-Jun-18 01:53 PM,But then don't they allow you to forward it if you don't opt-in to a mailbox?,
sony#1234,29-Jun-18 01:54 PM,"well if you chose forwarding, youre not able to send as your GT email",
sony#1234,29-Jun-18 01:54 PM,so people would be more hesitant to share sensitive information,
sony#1234,29-Jun-18 01:54 PM,im assuming that the logic behind it,
sony#1234,29-Jun-18 01:54 PM,if you dont opt into a mailbox you cant send emails as _____@gatech.edu,
sony#1234,29-Jun-18 01:55 PM,only recieve,
ratarafu#1603,29-Jun-18 01:55 PM,Makes sense. Thanks.,

suyashr99#7560,29-Jun-18 04:04 PM,thicc chinchilla,
saxon_dr#3806,29-Jun-18 04:04 PM,it's mostly just that the role that alcohol plays,
saxon_dr#3806,29-Jun-18 04:04 PM,is something that not necessarily everyone thinks of,
KyotoKoto#5113,29-Jun-18 04:05 PM,"wanna elaborate on that?, , on that topic of consent- i took a sexuality (sociology based) class last semester, and i was informed that consent is no longer just if the other party says ""yes"", we're supposed to look for ""enthusiastic content"". as in, your actions/body language/tone should match your words , , if it's a timidly said yes, obviously that's not in the realm of ""enthusiastic consent"". i enjoy the ""change"" in how consent is portrayed",
saxon_dr#3806,29-Jun-18 04:05 PM,so basically,
saxon_dr#3806,29-Jun-18 04:06 PM,"if the other person was drunk before you did it, they can say in the next morning that they didn't give consent and w/e they did under the influence is considered invalid",
saxon_dr#3806,29-Jun-18 04:06 PM,"same thing goes for you, as in you can't just say ""oh idk what i was doing i was drunk""",
saxon_dr#3806,29-Jun-18 04:06 PM,that's not a valid defense,
saxon_dr#3806,29-Jun-18 04:06 PM,yeah and what you said too,
saxon_dr#3806,29-Jun-18 04:07 PM,and then there is some stuff about,
saxon_dr#3806,29-Jun-18 04:07 PM,if this does happen to you,
saxon_dr#3806,29-Jun-18 04:07 PM,go to the sexual assault counseling or w/e place on campus first before you shower (even if you really want to) cuz you wanna preserve the evidence,
unahb#8581,29-Jun-18 04:08 PM,oh yeah dna,
KyotoKoto#5113,29-Jun-18 04:09 PM,"mhm, or police department or hospital/clinic? because they're probably going to do a rape kit",
saxon_dr#3806,29-Jun-18 04:09 PM,yeah just w/e place they do rape kit,
saxon_dr#3806,29-Jun-18 04:09 PM,apparently some campuses have special places where they do that,
joazlazer#2041,29-Jun-18 04:10 PM,not a huge fan of the alt right youtube community but that reminded me of this clip lol,

saxon_dr#3806,29-Jun-18 04:12 PM,idk what else they can do tho,
saxon_dr#3806,29-Jun-18 04:12 PM,at least it's moving in the right directions i guess?,
Snowfish#4289,29-Jun-18 04:12 PM,i think the idea is to just make people more aware,
Snowfish#4289,29-Jun-18 04:13 PM,like sometimes people (not just guys) will be so excited they just wont think about it,
Snowfish#4289,29-Jun-18 04:13 PM,but i guess if they drill it into their heads,
Snowfish#4289,29-Jun-18 04:13 PM,maybe shit will stop happening,
suyashr99#7560,29-Jun-18 04:13 PM,I agree,
Snowfish#4289,29-Jun-18 04:13 PM,"i don't think every ""rape"" is committed by a bad person, just ignorant people",
Snowfish#4289,29-Jun-18 04:13 PM,obviously there are some genuinely shitty people out there,
suyashr99#7560,29-Jun-18 04:13 PM,I think education is important,
Snowfish#4289,29-Jun-18 04:13 PM,yeah,
suyashr99#7560,29-Jun-18 04:13 PM,Rape is like India's biggest problem,
suyashr99#7560,29-Jun-18 04:14 PM,Mostly because everyone's uneducated,
Snowfish#4289,29-Jun-18 04:14 PM,yeah ive heard about that,
Snowfish#4289,29-Jun-18 04:14 PM,its super fucked,
suyashr99#7560,29-Jun-18 04:15 PM,It doesn't help that mob mentality is really bad too,
suyashr99#7560,29-Jun-18 04:15 PM,So people will go murder people on the road before legal process handles their deserved (imo) death penalty,
bopas2#1774,29-Jun-18 04:16 PM,"anyways, this consent thingy is something we all have to complete before this fall?",
Snowfish#4289,29-Jun-18 04:17 PM,yes,
Snowfish#4289,29-Jun-18 04:17 PM,it puts registration holds on your account if you don't do it,
BradfordOfMars#9837,29-Jun-18 04:17 PM,and then there's a part 2 that you have to complete during your first semester,
KyotoKoto#5113,29-Jun-18 04:19 PM,"^^on the topic of education, i feel like sexual education should be more comprehensive and should be started earlier on. (obviously i'm not advocating teaching the nitty gritty of sex to small children but there are appropriate ways to approach the topic, and also, i feel like it's appropriate to tell children about the actual name for body parts- at young ages, all the body parts are basically not as ""stigmatized"" as they are today) , , on that note, i've seen court cases where a child is testifying about someone molesting them, but since the child could not explicitly name the body part where he/she was touched, the molester's lawyer got the case thrown out. when i heard about that, that was really a feelsbadman.",
Snowfish#4289,29-Jun-18 04:20 PM,damn thats fucked up,
suyashr99#7560,29-Jun-18 04:20 PM,I feel bad that lawyers have to legally defend their client no matter what,
suyashr99#7560,29-Jun-18 04:20 PM,Even if their client is a scumbag that's 100% guilty,
saxon_dr#3806,29-Jun-18 04:21 PM,yeah that's pretty messed up,
suyashr99#7560,29-Jun-18 04:25 PM,How hard is it for me to get my hair dyed,
KyotoKoto#5113,29-Jun-18 04:25 PM,"oh yea, and abstinence only sex ed actually triggers me in the sense that sooner or later, people will [probably?] have sex, so they're going to need to be educated on the topic regardless. by not providing the education sooner, they're going to be ignorant of STIs, safe sex practices, etc later on. plus, you don't have formal sex ed when you're the average age that you're getting married, so where are these people going to get [properly] educated?? /rant over",

Snowfish#4289,29-Jun-18 11:24 PM,but i could be wrong,
Cole#0059,29-Jun-18 11:24 PM,"so if I'm lookin for a more competitive setting, club would be the way to go?",

8726andrew#5709,30-Jun-18 12:36 AM,But like people use it in books and stuff to kinda convey like time period context stuff and whatnot,

bopas2#1774,30-Jun-18 10:30 AM,and a great teacher,
saxon_dr#3806,30-Jun-18 10:30 AM,my econ teacher was like 70 but he was savage af,

saxon_dr#3806,30-Jun-18 10:33 AM,hmm i'm trying to think of some funny quotes that my teachers have said,
saxon_dr#3806,30-Jun-18 10:33 AM,i think i already mentioned the thing that my phys c teacher used to say,
saxon_dr#3806,30-Jun-18 10:34 AM,"Oh my English teacher says ""Knowing grammar is basically the difference between knowing your shit and knowing you're shit""",
8726andrew#5709,30-Jun-18 10:35 AM,That’s a generic internet quote lmao,
8726andrew#5709,30-Jun-18 10:35 AM,They probably stole it,
saxon_dr#3806,30-Jun-18 10:35 AM,he probably did,
saxon_dr#3806,30-Jun-18 10:35 AM,i'm sad that he never said it in my class,
saxon_dr#3806,30-Jun-18 10:36 AM,i heard about it from a classmate of mine,
ratarafu#1603,30-Jun-18 10:36 AM,Do outrageously incorrect statements count as funny quotes?,
8726andrew#5709,30-Jun-18 10:37 AM,English is a massively fucked up language with rules that don’t apply half the time,
8726andrew#5709,30-Jun-18 10:37 AM,But it’s the one we use on the internet so ¯\_(ツ)_/¯,
saxon_dr#3806,30-Jun-18 10:38 AM,lel sometimes i feel like chinese doesn't even have rules,
bopas2#1774,30-Jun-18 10:38 AM,"grammar is stupid, if people can understand what your saying, what’s the point?",
saxon_dr#3806,30-Jun-18 10:39 AM,i've always liked grammar :k3llyShrug:,
udishab#2211,30-Jun-18 10:39 AM,your used incorrectly makes me die inside,
saxon_dr#3806,30-Jun-18 10:39 AM,it's the methodical and scientific part of learning a language,
saxon_dr#3806,30-Jun-18 10:39 AM,and it's also a discrete math concept iirc <a:monkaSS:452208814846902273>,
8726andrew#5709,30-Jun-18 10:43 AM,The different your’s have different meanings,
8726andrew#5709,30-Jun-18 10:44 AM,"Your mom <- what about my mom, You’re Mom <- you are mom",

suyashr99#7560,30-Jun-18 11:20 AM,Sunscreen,
suyashr99#7560,30-Jun-18 11:21 AM,Don't need sunscreen if you never step outside,
sony#1234,30-Jun-18 11:21 AM,@suyashr99#7560 oh damn you right,
sony#1234,30-Jun-18 11:21 AM,Just gotta moisturize then,
bopas2#1774,30-Jun-18 11:21 AM,Don’t need to look pretty either,

suyashr99#7560,30-Jun-18 11:25 AM,Bruh,
suyashr99#7560,30-Jun-18 11:25 AM,I have to go to the bank,
suyashr99#7560,30-Jun-18 11:25 AM,Start building my credit score,
suyashr99#7560,30-Jun-18 11:25 AM,Like you said,
suyashr99#7560,30-Jun-18 11:25 AM,But send pictures,
suyashr99#7560,30-Jun-18 11:25 AM,So I can cry,
saxon_dr#3806,30-Jun-18 11:26 AM,i'll get a credit card once i trust myself more,
sony#1234,30-Jun-18 11:26 AM,@suyashr99#7560 which bank,
suyashr99#7560,30-Jun-18 11:27 AM,I don't know whatever one my parents use,
suyashr99#7560,30-Jun-18 11:27 AM,So wells or BofA,
sony#1234,30-Jun-18 11:27 AM,🤷‍♀️ Doesn't really matter. Credit cards are a mistake,
KyotoKoto#5113,30-Jun-18 11:28 AM,TLDR- don't buy more than you can pay for. pay your bills in full on time,
sony#1234,30-Jun-18 11:29 AM,Make sure you spend out of means so credit card companies make money,
sony#1234,30-Jun-18 11:29 AM,People have families to feed,
saxon_dr#3806,30-Jun-18 11:31 AM,the best way to use credit card in college imo is to just use it like cash or debit,
saxon_dr#3806,30-Jun-18 11:32 AM,i.e. only use it when you know you already have enuf funds,
saxon_dr#3806,30-Jun-18 11:32 AM,and just pay for it right after you use it,
saxon_dr#3806,30-Jun-18 11:32 AM,so you're basically using it just to raise your credit level,

saxon_dr#3806,30-Jun-18 12:28 PM,i don't really think it's funny at all but i just use it as a euphemism,
KyotoKoto#5113,30-Jun-18 12:28 PM,ah gotcha,
suyashr99#7560,30-Jun-18 12:28 PM,The new one piece chapter was titled seppuku :4Head:,

unahb#8581,30-Jun-18 12:29 PM,shonen?,

ratarafu#1603,30-Jun-18 01:20 PM,Don't need to shave if you grow a beard.,
waffle.dynasty#2740,30-Jun-18 01:20 PM,Yeah being blonde has its perks,
bopas2#1774,30-Jun-18 01:21 PM,can blonde people even grow good beards or not rlly,
suyashr99#7560,30-Jun-18 01:21 PM,Blonde beards sound weird,
ratarafu#1603,30-Jun-18 01:24 PM,"Are blonde beards real?, I thought blonde people had brown/red beards.",
saxon_dr#3806,30-Jun-18 01:25 PM,unless they also dye their bears otherwise it's real,
bopas2#1774,30-Jun-18 01:25 PM,i mean part of the not having the shave often is because blonde hair is hard to see so I dunno how facial hair really works,
saxon_dr#3806,30-Jun-18 01:25 PM,natural blonde people have blond everywhere,
saxon_dr#3806,30-Jun-18 01:25 PM,afaik,

Snowfish#4289,01-Jul-18 03:09 AM,i did literally the msot boring job possible,
Snowfish#4289,01-Jul-18 03:09 AM,summer of last year,
suyashr99#7560,01-Jul-18 03:09 AM,@unahb#8581 she could but she's part time and remote Lul,
Snowfish#4289,01-Jul-18 03:09 AM,and my manager recommended me to *every* manager,
Snowfish#4289,01-Jul-18 03:10 AM,and i took the one that offered me the most lax timeframes + remote,

Snowfish#4289,01-Jul-18 03:10 AM,s,
Snowfish#4289,01-Jul-18 03:10 AM,like automated scripts that tested every line of code,
unahb#8581,01-Jul-18 03:10 AM,yeh,
Snowfish#4289,01-Jul-18 03:10 AM,big companies typicaly have a line limit on code coverage,
Snowfish#4289,01-Jul-18 03:10 AM,to be able to push your code to production,
Snowfish#4289,01-Jul-18 03:11 AM,so they hired me to do the dirty work and bring the code coverage to what they accepted,
Snowfish#4289,01-Jul-18 03:11 AM,its super boring work but you get pretty big brownie points for being able to a) do it and b) do it without compalining,
unahb#8581,01-Jul-18 03:12 AM,nice,
Snowfish#4289,01-Jul-18 03:12 AM,getting ahead in the CS field basically boils down to doing what you're told,

saxon_dr#3806,01-Jul-18 11:02 AM,and you already explained to them how at GT most people struggle really hard at Phys 1211 and 1212? (or w/e those two are called),
bopas2#1774,01-Jul-18 11:03 AM,I really don't know,
bopas2#1774,01-Jul-18 11:03 AM,my mechanics teacher was a baboon and I literally don't know any angular physics or torque stuff,
bopas2#1774,01-Jul-18 11:04 AM,but idk how much i'll need that,
suyashr99#7560,01-Jul-18 11:04 AM,Yo,

saxon_dr#3806,01-Jul-18 11:04 AM,also i don't feel like it's worth to retake a whole course for like one or two things that you don't kow,
saxon_dr#3806,01-Jul-18 11:04 AM,did you also get all 5s? :Pog:,
suyashr99#7560,01-Jul-18 11:04 AM,Yes,

suyashr99#7560,01-Jul-18 11:05 AM,But we don't talk about that,
waffle.dynasty#2740,01-Jul-18 11:06 AM,You only need credit from one econ test right?,
suyashr99#7560,01-Jul-18 11:06 AM,They give two different credits,
saxon_dr#3806,01-Jul-18 11:06 AM,oh i guess,

waffle.dynasty#2740,01-Jul-18 11:08 AM,Is Moosh an econ major?,

saxon_dr#3806,01-Jul-18 11:12 AM,you don't need to get that much right,
saxon_dr#3806,01-Jul-18 11:12 AM,you can literally skip a a whole frq and still get 5,
suyashr99#7560,01-Jul-18 11:12 AM,5 on e&m is actually impressive,
suyashr99#7560,01-Jul-18 11:12 AM,Congrats cha fos e,

saxon_dr#3806,01-Jul-18 11:15 AM,but not sure if he's gonna,
saxon_dr#3806,01-Jul-18 11:15 AM,cuz his parents don't want him to,
bopas2#1774,01-Jul-18 11:15 AM,"literally i told my mom my scores and she said congrats...then 5 minutes later she said ""i still don't know if you should skip calculus""",
saxon_dr#3806,01-Jul-18 11:15 AM,???,
saxon_dr#3806,01-Jul-18 11:15 AM,not even calc?,

bopas2#1774,01-Jul-18 11:16 AM,:arthurfist:,
MKA#5877,01-Jul-18 11:16 AM,o shit gotta check AP,
saxon_dr#3806,01-Jul-18 11:16 AM,then what did your parents pay all that stupid money to the collegeboard for,
saxon_dr#3806,01-Jul-18 11:16 AM,isn't it like 89 dollars or smth,
saxon_dr#3806,01-Jul-18 11:16 AM,wow i was wrong it's 94,
saxon_dr#3806,01-Jul-18 11:16 AM,:lilyTilt:,
KyotoKoto#5113,01-Jul-18 11:16 AM,my school district always paid for my ap tests,
saxon_dr#3806,01-Jul-18 11:17 AM,nani,
KyotoKoto#5113,01-Jul-18 11:17 AM,I did not know that was not the norm,
bopas2#1774,01-Jul-18 11:17 AM,y'all want to help me to formulate an argument for me towards exempting classes?,
saxon_dr#3806,01-Jul-18 11:17 AM,maybe it's just cuz i went to a private school,
suyashr99#7560,01-Jul-18 11:17 AM,Yes,
saxon_dr#3806,01-Jul-18 11:17 AM,yeah sure,
suyashr99#7560,01-Jul-18 11:17 AM,You save money on tuition,
bopas2#1774,01-Jul-18 11:17 AM,also i spent like some 600$ on ap exams :FeelsGoodMan:,
Chafos#1781,01-Jul-18 11:17 AM,yeah my parents had to pay for all mine,
saxon_dr#3806,01-Jul-18 11:17 AM,:FeelsGoodMan:,
bopas2#1774,01-Jul-18 11:17 AM,(this year),
saxon_dr#3806,01-Jul-18 11:17 AM,what,
saxon_dr#3806,01-Jul-18 11:17 AM,nani,
suyashr99#7560,01-Jul-18 11:17 AM,You save your GPA,
suyashr99#7560,01-Jul-18 11:17 AM,Because those classes are harder in college,
suyashr99#7560,01-Jul-18 11:18 AM,And since you already have a nice grasp,
suyashr99#7560,01-Jul-18 11:18 AM,You can just refresh,
suyashr99#7560,01-Jul-18 11:18 AM,Also,
suyashr99#7560,01-Jul-18 11:18 AM,You'll fall behind your peers,
suyashr99#7560,01-Jul-18 11:18 AM,Because everyone at tech takes credit,
saxon_dr#3806,01-Jul-18 11:18 AM,and if you relearn something you already know it's really boring and sometimes you lose motivation to study,
saxon_dr#3806,01-Jul-18 11:18 AM,idk if you do that,
suyashr99#7560,01-Jul-18 11:18 AM,So you'll be graduating in 5 years,
saxon_dr#3806,01-Jul-18 11:18 AM,but that happens to me,
suyashr99#7560,01-Jul-18 11:18 AM,Also you lose out on cool opportunities like internships and co-op ($$$),
suyashr99#7560,01-Jul-18 11:19 AM,show them shoulditakethecredit.com to confirm tech culture,
saxon_dr#3806,01-Jul-18 11:19 AM,and from what people are saying those courses are less about making sure you have solid foundations and more about giving you a lot of work to see if you can handle it,
KyotoKoto#5113,01-Jul-18 11:19 AM,and work experience,
MKA#5877,01-Jul-18 11:19 AM,HOLY SHIT I GOT A 5 ON BOTH PHYSICS C’S WTF,

KyotoKoto#5113,01-Jul-18 11:21 AM,you could have paid for expedited processing if that was relevant to you,
saxon_dr#3806,01-Jul-18 11:21 AM,oh so apparently,
saxon_dr#3806,01-Jul-18 11:21 AM,since it's so close to the fifth,
saxon_dr#3806,01-Jul-18 11:21 AM,they just send it everything ordered from 25th to 3rd on the 3rd as expedited,
bopas2#1774,01-Jul-18 11:21 AM,lit,

bopas2#1774,01-Jul-18 12:09 PM,it's subjective,
bopas2#1774,01-Jul-18 12:09 PM,chem was alot easier for me than bio - but bio was my first AP class so maybe I was just a noobie,
8726andrew#5709,01-Jul-18 12:09 PM,Personally not a fan of either one lmao,
8726andrew#5709,01-Jul-18 12:09 PM,I’m more of a physics guy,
suyashr99#7560,01-Jul-18 12:10 PM,I liked ap chem a lot,
suyashr99#7560,01-Jul-18 12:10 PM,Both the class and exam,

KyotoKoto#5113,01-Jul-18 12:24 PM,"didn't really ""learn"" anything per se tbh, but it was a refreshing type of a lecture to listen to, , for example, it emphasized on multi-faceted analysis and I guess ""taught"" you had to think. think of why things happen--why we experience mass incarceration, etc",

suyashr99#7560,01-Jul-18 12:29 PM,It's probably better to get the nes they relaunched,

Chafos#1781,01-Jul-18 01:25 PM,ok so quick question,
Chafos#1781,01-Jul-18 01:25 PM,"if i have credit for ap chem, and both of the ap physics, since the cs degree only requires you to take 3 science classes, 2 of which are in succession, do i not have to take any lab sciences?",

Rye#0666,01-Jul-18 01:27 PM,Well Lit was really brutal this year so I don't feel too bad about getting a 3 on that too,
saxon_dr#3806,01-Jul-18 01:27 PM,oh but chafos i remember some current student saying that there is still a chance the advisor cucks us and make us take some lab science :thonk:,
Rye#0666,01-Jul-18 01:27 PM,And I've always sucked at English,

KyotoKoto#5113,01-Jul-18 01:27 PM,@Rye#0666 if you don't want to take 2212 at tech you could always take it at perimeter college (community College) and transfer the credit,
Rye#0666,01-Jul-18 01:27 PM,I thought I could've gotten a 5 but no big deal,
Chafos#1781,01-Jul-18 01:27 PM,just nice to have more space for my other classes,
KyotoKoto#5113,01-Jul-18 01:27 PM,you can save your sanity and time lol,
suyashr99#7560,01-Jul-18 01:27 PM,@KyotoKoto#5113 tell me more,
8726andrew#5709,01-Jul-18 01:27 PM,ryan's in LA rn lol,
KyotoKoto#5113,01-Jul-18 01:28 PM,I mean a lot of the core classes you can take at a community College,
KyotoKoto#5113,01-Jul-18 01:28 PM,and then transfer it,
KyotoKoto#5113,01-Jul-18 01:28 PM,go on Oscar,
KyotoKoto#5113,01-Jul-18 01:28 PM,and look up the transfer credit catalog,
suyashr99#7560,01-Jul-18 01:28 PM,I'm high key considering this,
saxon_dr#3806,01-Jul-18 01:28 PM,"yeah same i might take some phys course cuz i do like it, but just wanted to give you an fyi @Chafos#1781",
KyotoKoto#5113,01-Jul-18 01:28 PM,"to see if the credit transfers or not, , plus it's cheaper",
Chafos#1781,01-Jul-18 01:29 PM,"yeah, appreciate the heads up!  personally i'd prob do chem or bio since e&m was slightly traumatizing",
suyashr99#7560,01-Jul-18 01:29 PM,Take environmental science,
suyashr99#7560,01-Jul-18 01:29 PM,If they force you,
saxon_dr#3806,01-Jul-18 01:30 PM,i'm considering more like quantum mechanics even though i'm probably gonna get mind fucked by it,
Chafos#1781,01-Jul-18 01:30 PM,environmental science :OMEGALUL:,
saxon_dr#3806,01-Jul-18 01:30 PM,just cuz it sounds fun,
Chafos#1781,01-Jul-18 01:30 PM,are you sure about that lmao,
saxon_dr#3806,01-Jul-18 01:30 PM,well i'll only do that if i feel like my gpa can take a hit,
Chafos#1781,01-Jul-18 01:30 PM,i agree it sounds fun,
Chafos#1781,01-Jul-18 01:30 PM,but like hella hard too,
saxon_dr#3806,01-Jul-18 01:30 PM,yeah that's what i'm saying i'll only do it if i'm confident my gpa can take that hit,
Chafos#1781,01-Jul-18 01:30 PM,gotcha,
KyotoKoto#5113,01-Jul-18 01:30 PM,I want to take an AI class but then I'd have to take a bunch of CS classes as prereqs,

suyashr99#7560,01-Jul-18 01:32 PM,Probably quickest ROI,
8726andrew#5709,01-Jul-18 01:33 PM,i think snowfish has said this before but like you'll be hella limited on classes you can take because of pre reqs and itll probably be all major specific stuff,
suyashr99#7560,01-Jul-18 01:33 PM,That or like cloud computing/engineering,
Chafos#1781,01-Jul-18 01:33 PM,i've never taken a stat class so i definitely will take some for fun as well,
KyotoKoto#5113,01-Jul-18 01:33 PM,@8726andrew#5709 maybe for CS but business doesn't really have that issue,
KyotoKoto#5113,01-Jul-18 01:33 PM,or at least it's not really bad for business,

suyashr99#7560,01-Jul-18 03:34 PM,The other doesn't,
joazlazer#2041,01-Jul-18 03:34 PM,or is 1310 > 1211k,
joazlazer#2041,01-Jul-18 03:34 PM,and 1212k is still the next step,
sony#1234,01-Jul-18 03:34 PM,1310 > 1211k,
sony#1234,01-Jul-18 03:35 PM,1212k is after 1310 or 1211,

sony#1234,01-Jul-18 03:37 PM,it doesnt matter unless your major is chem related,
Pear0#9325,01-Jul-18 03:38 PM,it could be important if taking 1212k and 1212k builds on stuff not covered by 1310,
Pear0#9325,01-Jul-18 03:38 PM,"but yeah, doesn't matter if only one chem course is required",
sony#1234,01-Jul-18 03:39 PM,GT determined that 1310 is sufficient for 1212k and that requirement has been held for a long time,
sony#1234,01-Jul-18 03:39 PM,so i wouldnt worry about it,

suyashr99#7560,01-Jul-18 04:52 PM,between classic and modern,
Snowfish#4289,01-Jul-18 04:53 PM,not entirely sure about classic but i believe it’s closer to what you learn in ap physics,
Snowfish#4289,01-Jul-18 04:53 PM,modern is like a lot of computer simulation and therefore more vector based than integral based,
Snowfish#4289,01-Jul-18 04:53 PM,it has a lot to do with the change of momentum and how it relates to motion and direction,
Snowfish#4289,01-Jul-18 04:53 PM,whereas in classic you just kind of learn momentum = mass * velocity and call it a day,
Snowfish#4289,01-Jul-18 04:54 PM,but you do learn circular everything in classic,
Snowfish#4289,01-Jul-18 04:54 PM,angular momentum etc etc,
saxon_dr#3806,01-Jul-18 04:54 PM,lmao,
saxon_dr#3806,01-Jul-18 04:54 PM,that was hilarious,
saxon_dr#3806,01-Jul-18 04:54 PM,i liked that,
Snowfish#4289,01-Jul-18 04:54 PM,but in modern you just learn dp/dt parallel and perpendicular,
Snowfish#4289,01-Jul-18 04:54 PM,it’s weird,
saxon_dr#3806,01-Jul-18 04:54 PM,his five stages taht is,
Snowfish#4289,01-Jul-18 04:54 PM,it’s great,
Snowfish#4289,01-Jul-18 04:54 PM,isn’t it,

Thedarkbobman#8576,01-Jul-18 05:10 PM,everytime i have tried to install cuda i have completly fucked up my drivers,
Pear0#9325,01-Jul-18 05:10 PM,use linux,
Pear0#9325,01-Jul-18 05:11 PM,it does for cuda,
Pear0#9325,01-Jul-18 05:11 PM,in general they fuck over linux,
Pear0#9325,01-Jul-18 05:11 PM,but I've found installing cuda to be a lot easier on linux than windows,
Pear0#9325,01-Jul-18 05:12 PM,yeah,
Pear0#9325,01-Jul-18 05:13 PM,my desktop is linux and in the past every once in a while it wouldn't boot to the desktop and I'd have to reinstall the nvidia drivers in recovery,
Pear0#9325,01-Jul-18 05:13 PM,but I haven't had to do that in at least 6 months now,
Thedarkbobman#8576,01-Jul-18 05:14 PM,so i tried it first on windows,
Thedarkbobman#8576,01-Jul-18 05:14 PM,and it royally fucked up,
Thedarkbobman#8576,01-Jul-18 05:14 PM,then i tried it on linux,
Thedarkbobman#8576,01-Jul-18 05:14 PM,and it also fucked up but not as bad,
Snowfish#4289,01-Jul-18 05:15 PM,i just watched the whole video,

HM04#1608,01-Jul-18 05:21 PM,Or is it somewhere on the tech site?,

sony#1234,01-Jul-18 05:22 PM,try their website,

nthistle#9117,01-Jul-18 06:03 PM,just curious but what happens if you sign up for a class with TBD time and it turns out to be a conflict,
nthistle#9117,01-Jul-18 06:03 PM,or have all TBDs been determined by phase 2,
saxon_dr#3806,01-Jul-18 06:03 PM,hmm not sure,

Snowfish#4289,01-Jul-18 06:15 PM,just make an alternative,
saxon_dr#3806,01-Jul-18 06:15 PM,i'd rather wake up for 8 AM than getting fked by bad profs,
saxon_dr#3806,01-Jul-18 06:15 PM,i think,

Snowfish#4289,01-Jul-18 06:18 PM,i took the worst professor for a few classes,
joazlazer#2041,01-Jul-18 06:18 PM,omg,

thedragonlegacy#2854,01-Jul-18 06:24 PM,it needed to be more readable,
8726andrew#5709,01-Jul-18 06:24 PM,its less readable,
8726andrew#5709,01-Jul-18 06:24 PM,now the GT is just blocked by a bunch of yellow,
8726andrew#5709,01-Jul-18 06:25 PM,i think we should go back and joseph can just suffer,

thedragonlegacy#2854,01-Jul-18 06:28 PM,i walked ten thousand miles and fought 20 dragons to get that logo,
saxon_dr#3806,01-Jul-18 06:28 PM,why do some sections have more classes per week than others,
saxon_dr#3806,01-Jul-18 06:29 PM,dragonlegacy name checks out,
Snowfish#4289,01-Jul-18 06:29 PM,what do you mean,
Snowfish#4289,01-Jul-18 06:29 PM,more classes per week,
Snowfish#4289,01-Jul-18 06:29 PM,like what,
saxon_dr#3806,01-Jul-18 06:30 PM,so this is two english per week,https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/402517390669381633/463109188491673611/unknown.png
saxon_dr#3806,01-Jul-18 06:30 PM,this is three per week,https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/402517390669381633/463109260344295426/unknown.png
Snowfish#4289,01-Jul-18 06:31 PM,because classes are typically MWF or TR,
Snowfish#4289,01-Jul-18 06:31 PM,MWF is 1hr/day and TR is 1.5hr/day,
Snowfish#4289,01-Jul-18 06:31 PM,so it sums up to 3hr/week,
saxon_dr#3806,01-Jul-18 06:31 PM,oh rite i didn't look at the block length,
saxon_dr#3806,01-Jul-18 06:31 PM,so do i not need to worry about these section codes,https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/402517390669381633/463109535985565718/unknown.png
Snowfish#4289,01-Jul-18 06:32 PM,i think HP might be honors,
saxon_dr#3806,01-Jul-18 06:33 PM,does that just mean it's harder or i can't sign up for it cuz i'm not in honors program,
Snowfish#4289,01-Jul-18 06:34 PM,you cannto sign up for it,
suyashr99#7560,01-Jul-18 06:34 PM,It's for nerds in an LLC,
Snowfish#4289,01-Jul-18 06:35 PM,all of the people i know in it hate it,

saxon_dr#3806,01-Jul-18 06:51 PM,is it actually somewhat interesting,
Snowfish#4289,01-Jul-18 06:52 PM,no,
Snowfish#4289,01-Jul-18 06:52 PM,skip every class,
Snowfish#4289,01-Jul-18 06:52 PM,read the textbook,
nthistle#9117,01-Jul-18 06:52 PM,you're only at 13 hours right @saxon_dr#3806 ? you could technically fit the 2 hour wellness class if you wanted,
saxon_dr#3806,01-Jul-18 06:52 PM,true :thonk:,
saxon_dr#3806,01-Jul-18 06:53 PM,btw for this what is the motivation for choosing the ones with more hours,https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/402517390669381633/463114948222910465/unknown.png
Snowfish#4289,01-Jul-18 06:53 PM,um,
Snowfish#4289,01-Jul-18 06:53 PM,i think its just if you want to do it,
Snowfish#4289,01-Jul-18 06:53 PM,like if you're already doing research,
sony#1234,01-Jul-18 06:53 PM,VIP can be kinda fun 🤷,
Snowfish#4289,01-Jul-18 06:53 PM,why would you not let it count,
sony#1234,01-Jul-18 06:54 PM,some interesting projects out there,
saxon_dr#3806,01-Jul-18 06:54 PM,oh ok,
Snowfish#4289,01-Jul-18 06:54 PM,not just taking the normal option so yu can sleep through it,
Snowfish#4289,01-Jul-18 06:54 PM,:OMEGALUL:,
nthistle#9117,01-Jul-18 06:54 PM,research option appears on your diploma too,
saxon_dr#3806,01-Jul-18 06:54 PM,that's what i thought but i wasn't sure if there was anything else,
sony#1234,01-Jul-18 06:54 PM,your diploma means nothing,
nthistle#9117,01-Jul-18 06:54 PM,if that matters to you,
nthistle#9117,01-Jul-18 06:54 PM,xd,
nthistle#9117,01-Jul-18 06:54 PM,well I want to do it for grad school anyways,
saxon_dr#3806,01-Jul-18 06:54 PM,same :k3llyLost:,
nthistle#9117,01-Jul-18 06:55 PM,"inb4 ""freshies already thinking about grad school?1?""",
saxon_dr#3806,01-Jul-18 06:55 PM,"tbh i kinda just asked that only looking at the hours, now that i'm actually reading the content it makes more sense to me",
saxon_dr#3806,01-Jul-18 06:55 PM,well actually i think a lot of people here are thinking about grad school already,
suyashr99#7560,01-Jul-18 06:56 PM,I want a PhD,
thedragonlegacy#2854,01-Jul-18 06:56 PM,mr. professor @nthistle#9117,
nthistle#9117,01-Jul-18 06:56 PM,yikes that's me,
saxon_dr#3806,01-Jul-18 06:56 PM,that timing,
nthistle#9117,01-Jul-18 06:56 PM,me @ephemeral#9464,
suyashr99#7560,01-Jul-18 06:56 PM,So I can be a doctor engineer,
nthistle#9117,01-Jul-18 06:56 PM,I want to be (relatively) poor,
Snowfish#4289,01-Jul-18 06:56 PM,CS grad school :OMEGALUL:,
suyashr99#7560,01-Jul-18 06:56 PM,And satisfy my parents,
Snowfish#4289,01-Jul-18 06:56 PM,honestly even bachelors in CS are starting to become irrelevant,
nthistle#9117,01-Jul-18 06:57 PM,I mean most people don't get a phd with the intent of working in industry,
nthistle#9117,01-Jul-18 06:57 PM,even though most do,
Snowfish#4289,01-Jul-18 06:57 PM,im talking mostly about masters,
Snowfish#4289,01-Jul-18 06:57 PM,masters in CS are actually pointless,
Snowfish#4289,01-Jul-18 06:57 PM,it has like negative value,
nthistle#9117,01-Jul-18 06:58 PM,o p p o r t u n i t y c o s t,
Snowfish#4289,01-Jul-18 06:58 PM,i think the only reason to get one is if you get a really sick deal for it,
Snowfish#4289,01-Jul-18 06:58 PM,networking,
Snowfish#4289,01-Jul-18 06:58 PM,yeah,
Snowfish#4289,01-Jul-18 06:59 PM,i mean,
Snowfish#4289,01-Jul-18 06:59 PM,its just easier,
Snowfish#4289,01-Jul-18 06:59 PM,getting a job with no degree is hard,
suyashr99#7560,01-Jul-18 06:59 PM,I wonder if cs will become like engineering where you need engineering and licencing and shit,
Snowfish#4289,01-Jul-18 06:59 PM,you have to make portfolios and shit,
Snowfish#4289,01-Jul-18 06:59 PM,no it never will,
Snowfish#4289,01-Jul-18 06:59 PM,you can learn to do just about anything CS related in your underwear,
saxon_dr#3806,01-Jul-18 06:59 PM,i mean you can just code sht on a laptop,
saxon_dr#3806,01-Jul-18 07:00 PM,you don't need to be handling special equipments for the most part,
Snowfish#4289,01-Jul-18 07:01 PM,im talking like,
Snowfish#4289,01-Jul-18 07:01 PM,if you have no experience,
Snowfish#4289,01-Jul-18 07:01 PM,or well,
Snowfish#4289,01-Jul-18 07:01 PM,no legit experience,
Snowfish#4289,01-Jul-18 07:01 PM,"like you gotta be like ""here's what i can do""",
suyashr99#7560,01-Jul-18 07:01 PM,My cousin dropped out GT in his third year and now he works for the NFL,
suyashr99#7560,01-Jul-18 07:01 PM,So it's possible,

suyashr99#7560,01-Jul-18 07:38 PM,What is your guys opinion,
suyashr99#7560,01-Jul-18 07:38 PM,On the fact that black hair doesn't actually exist,
suyashr99#7560,01-Jul-18 07:38 PM,It's just darker shades of brown,
nthistle#9117,01-Jul-18 07:38 PM,that's stupid,
suyashr99#7560,01-Jul-18 07:38 PM,It's true tho,
8726andrew#5709,01-Jul-18 07:38 PM,thats objectively wrong,
saxon_dr#3806,01-Jul-18 07:38 PM,that's like saying black isn't a color it's a lack of color,
unahb#8581,01-Jul-18 07:39 PM,Hi hos,
suyashr99#7560,01-Jul-18 07:39 PM,But it's true,
nthistle#9117,01-Jul-18 07:39 PM,you might as well say the color brown doesn't exist and it's just darker shades of orange,
saxon_dr#3806,01-Jul-18 07:39 PM,i feel like it's just semantics,
unahb#8581,01-Jul-18 07:39 PM,Are we still playing spyfall??,
8726andrew#5709,01-Jul-18 07:39 PM,literally black is just darker shades of any color,

KyotoKoto#5113,01-Jul-18 07:39 PM,"my hair is black but in the sunlight it's light brown, so i suppose that kinda supports that premise. but idk, it just sounds dumb that black hair doesn't exist--I'm sure there are people have black hair in different types of light",
8726andrew#5709,01-Jul-18 07:40 PM,thats just light reflecting off it,
unahb#8581,01-Jul-18 07:40 PM,Just like black eyes don’t exist just dark brown?,

suyashr99#7560,01-Jul-18 07:42 PM,Colors aren't real,

Snowfish#4289,01-Jul-18 11:49 PM,but a story you tell at a party,
Snowfish#4289,01-Jul-18 11:49 PM,you know?,
Snowfish#4289,01-Jul-18 11:49 PM,anyways,
suyashr99#7560,01-Jul-18 11:49 PM,Nerds partying?,
Snowfish#4289,01-Jul-18 11:50 PM,no,
Snowfish#4289,01-Jul-18 11:50 PM,anywho,
Snowfish#4289,01-Jul-18 11:50 PM,lets set the stage,
thedragonlegacy#2854,01-Jul-18 11:50 PM,i need to make a meme about story time,
Snowfish#4289,01-Jul-18 11:50 PM,"so this is in the cold, cold months of atlanta",
Snowfish#4289,01-Jul-18 11:50 PM,meaning it was like 30 degrees at night,
Snowfish#4289,01-Jul-18 11:50 PM,absolutely insane,
Snowfish#4289,01-Jul-18 11:50 PM,well in reality these were actually cold months and it was like 14 one night,
sony#1234,01-Jul-18 11:50 PM,Anything under 90 is too cold for me,
Snowfish#4289,01-Jul-18 11:51 PM,"so to go back to the ancient story time of old, i believe you all might recall a story about the mysterious witch known as my roommate",
Snowfish#4289,01-Jul-18 11:51 PM,now a snowfish slightly younger than this one,
Snowfish#4289,01-Jul-18 11:51 PM,had a flawless strategy,
Snowfish#4289,01-Jul-18 11:51 PM,take all classes after 2PM,
Snowfish#4289,01-Jul-18 11:51 PM,"stay up until very, very late at night",
Snowfish#4289,01-Jul-18 11:52 PM,then sleep until class and stay up,
Snowfish#4289,01-Jul-18 11:52 PM,"the ""nocturnal"" strategy",
Snowfish#4289,01-Jul-18 11:52 PM,armed with bags and bags of instant ramen,
Snowfish#4289,01-Jul-18 11:52 PM,i set off on this journey,
Snowfish#4289,01-Jul-18 11:52 PM,"now, you might ask, what is there to do very, very late at night on a college campus",
Snowfish#4289,01-Jul-18 11:52 PM,that does not include going to your room?,
Snowfish#4289,01-Jul-18 11:52 PM,well i don't know either so i just walked around the freshman dorms,
Snowfish#4289,01-Jul-18 11:53 PM,"like outside, i was always too beta to try to walk inside the dorms at night because i might get arrested or shot or whatever they do to trespassers",
Snowfish#4289,01-Jul-18 11:53 PM,so anyways,
Snowfish#4289,01-Jul-18 11:53 PM,slightly younger snowfish would wander around,
Snowfish#4289,01-Jul-18 11:53 PM,from about midnight - 6-8AM,
Snowfish#4289,01-Jul-18 11:53 PM,(because everything would start to close at midnight and i'd feel weird),
Snowfish#4289,01-Jul-18 11:54 PM,"sometimes i'd bring my laptop, sometimes i'd go hang out with people, sometimes i'd just sit on a bench and browse memes on my phone",
Snowfish#4289,01-Jul-18 11:54 PM,er sorry sometimes slightly younger snowfish would do these things,
Snowfish#4289,01-Jul-18 11:54 PM,so anyways on one particularly cold night,
Snowfish#4289,01-Jul-18 11:54 PM,"i was shivering to death on a bench, fingers shaking too much to even touch my phone",
Snowfish#4289,01-Jul-18 11:54 PM,so about 60 degrees,
unahb#8581,01-Jul-18 11:55 PM,Why does Prithvi Kanan follow everyone on Instagram,
Snowfish#4289,01-Jul-18 11:55 PM,(it was actually like 10 something),
Snowfish#4289,01-Jul-18 11:55 PM,EXCUSE ME,
Snowfish#4289,01-Jul-18 11:55 PM,"so there i am on a bench, cold as fuck",
Snowfish#4289,01-Jul-18 11:55 PM,and a buddy of mine who shall remain unnamed is also there with me,
Snowfish#4289,01-Jul-18 11:55 PM,and we're talking because that's the only way to not succumb to the frozen wasteland that is slightly below freezing georgia,
suyashr99#7560,01-Jul-18 11:55 PM,"""buddy""",
Snowfish#4289,01-Jul-18 11:55 PM,and it's about 4AM,
Snowfish#4289,01-Jul-18 11:55 PM,no stirring of life in 2 hours,
Snowfish#4289,01-Jul-18 11:56 PM,"and then, as we're sitting there chatting, one of the doors to one of the dorms open",
Snowfish#4289,01-Jul-18 11:56 PM,and this strange figure stumbles outside,
Snowfish#4289,01-Jul-18 11:56 PM,and he walks in a circle,
Snowfish#4289,01-Jul-18 11:56 PM,then disappears down one of the alleyways,
Snowfish#4289,01-Jul-18 11:56 PM,"interesting way of navigating, going a full 350 degree circle rather than going 10 degrees the other way to reach said alleyway",
Snowfish#4289,01-Jul-18 11:56 PM,regardless,
Snowfish#4289,01-Jul-18 11:56 PM,"we say 'huh how strange"" and continue talking about whatever it is we were talking about",
Snowfish#4289,01-Jul-18 11:57 PM,then the strange figure appears on the other side of the big ass field,
Snowfish#4289,01-Jul-18 11:57 PM,walks up the stairs,
Snowfish#4289,01-Jul-18 11:57 PM,circles around again,
Snowfish#4289,01-Jul-18 11:57 PM,and walks down the same alleyway he had gone down before,
Snowfish#4289,01-Jul-18 11:57 PM,let me draw a picture,
Snowfish#4289,01-Jul-18 11:57 PM,wait i dont have paint on this computer,
Snowfish#4289,01-Jul-18 11:57 PM,what's a good alternative to paint,
thedragonlegacy#2854,01-Jul-18 11:57 PM,whiteboard,
ratarafu#1603,01-Jul-18 11:57 PM,https://sketch.io/sketchpad/,
nthistle#9117,01-Jul-18 11:57 PM,there is no alternative,
thedragonlegacy#2854,01-Jul-18 11:57 PM,https://awwapp.com/b/upd8ert4o/,
nthistle#9117,01-Jul-18 11:57 PM,ms paint is superior to everything,
Snowfish#4289,01-Jul-18 11:58 PM,https://puu.sh/APrNU/2890af93e0.png,
thedragonlegacy#2854,01-Jul-18 11:58 PM,which one,
thedragonlegacy#2854,01-Jul-18 11:58 PM,ok,
Snowfish#4289,01-Jul-18 11:58 PM,so let me draw his path out for a second,
Lennox#3038,01-Jul-18 11:58 PM,so immersed with these visuals,
suyashr99#7560,01-Jul-18 11:59 PM,I know exactly what's going on,
Chafos#1781,01-Jul-18 11:59 PM,*innovation that excites*,
Snowfish#4289,01-Jul-18 11:59 PM,https://puu.sh/APrP4/f02ceef3ef.png,
Snowfish#4289,01-Jul-18 11:59 PM,so this is his path,
suyashr99#7560,01-Jul-18 11:59 PM,*sense of pride and accomplishment*,
Snowfish#4289,01-Jul-18 11:59 PM,roughly,
udishab#2211,01-Jul-18 11:59 PM,i love how nu is being so elaborate w this story to include these diagrams,
Snowfish#4289,01-Jul-18 11:59 PM,now,
Snowfish#4289,01-Jul-18 11:59 PM,at this point we are perplexed,
Snowfish#4289,01-Jul-18 11:59 PM,"and i go ""is he following the same path?""",
Snowfish#4289,01-Jul-18 11:59 PM,so we sit and we wait,
Snowfish#4289,01-Jul-18 11:59 PM,"the clock runs, my fingers are still cold",
Snowfish#4289,01-Jul-18 11:59 PM,and then,
Snowfish#4289,01-Jul-18 11:59 PM,a little head appears on the stairs,
Snowfish#4289,01-Jul-18 11:59 PM,and then a body,
Snowfish#4289,01-Jul-18 11:59 PM,and he appears,
Snowfish#4289,02-Jul-18 12:00 AM,he walks up the stairs,
Snowfish#4289,02-Jul-18 12:00 AM,takes a left,
Snowfish#4289,02-Jul-18 12:00 AM,goes to --,
Snowfish#4289,02-Jul-18 12:00 AM,well its not on the drawing,
Snowfish#4289,02-Jul-18 12:00 AM,give me a moment,
Snowfish#4289,02-Jul-18 12:00 AM,https://puu.sh/APrR4/60edc36379.png,
thedragonlegacy#2854,02-Jul-18 12:00 AM,nice,
Snowfish#4289,02-Jul-18 12:00 AM,so he goes by the tree,
Snowfish#4289,02-Jul-18 12:00 AM,runs his hand along the tree,
Snowfish#4289,02-Jul-18 12:00 AM,jumps over the rock,
Snowfish#4289,02-Jul-18 12:01 AM,and continues the circle,
Snowfish#4289,02-Jul-18 12:01 AM,"and we go ""alright, if he does the tree thing and the rock thing again, he's following a cycle.""",
Snowfish#4289,02-Jul-18 12:01 AM,so the clock runs,
Snowfish#4289,02-Jul-18 12:01 AM,the head appears on the stairs,
Snowfish#4289,02-Jul-18 12:01 AM,he turns left,
Snowfish#4289,02-Jul-18 12:01 AM,he runs his hand along the tree,
Snowfish#4289,02-Jul-18 12:01 AM,jumps over the rock,
Snowfish#4289,02-Jul-18 12:01 AM,and we're like,
Snowfish#4289,02-Jul-18 12:01 AM,HOLY FUCK,
Snowfish#4289,02-Jul-18 12:01 AM,and so we do the logical thing,
Snowfish#4289,02-Jul-18 12:01 AM,and we start following him,
thedragonlegacy#2854,02-Jul-18 12:01 AM,what head ??,
Snowfish#4289,02-Jul-18 12:01 AM,his head,
Snowfish#4289,02-Jul-18 12:01 AM,so we start following him right,
Snowfish#4289,02-Jul-18 12:02 AM,(i brought one of my knives so its ok we werent gonna die),
Snowfish#4289,02-Jul-18 12:02 AM,so we realize he goes on this strange route,
sony#1234,02-Jul-18 12:02 AM,@Snowfish#4289 woah a weapon? Zero tolerance my guy,
Snowfish#4289,02-Jul-18 12:02 AM,"goes down the alleyway, goes up to some tree and picnic table on the other side of the dorm, stands there for a bit muttering/singing/something to himself, then walks away, muttering quietly under his breath",
Gadget246#0848,02-Jul-18 12:02 AM,since we have the snap group we'll all have seen each other before so i don't think it will be that weird to meet each other,
nthistle#9117,02-Jul-18 12:02 AM,sorry to interrupt but how many knives do you own,
MEE6#4876,02-Jul-18 12:02 AM,"GG @nthistle#9117, you just advanced to level 7!",
Snowfish#4289,02-Jul-18 12:02 AM,and just does the rest of the loop,
Snowfish#4289,02-Jul-18 12:02 AM,IRRELEVANT QUESTION,
Snowfish#4289,02-Jul-18 12:02 AM,anyways,
Snowfish#4289,02-Jul-18 12:02 AM,so we're like,
brumeux#4293,02-Jul-18 12:02 AM,shhh story,
Snowfish#4289,02-Jul-18 12:02 AM,"""dude this is so fucking weird""",
Snowfish#4289,02-Jul-18 12:02 AM,"so we keep following him, he does the **exact** same thing",
Snowfish#4289,02-Jul-18 12:02 AM,like down to a letter,
sony#1234,02-Jul-18 12:03 AM,Knives have to shorter than 2 inches otherwise it's a weapon lul,
Snowfish#4289,02-Jul-18 12:03 AM,"i call out to him one time like ""hey?""",
Snowfish#4289,02-Jul-18 12:03 AM,no response,
Snowfish#4289,02-Jul-18 12:03 AM,i step in front of him on his path,
Snowfish#4289,02-Jul-18 12:03 AM,he ignores me,
Snowfish#4289,02-Jul-18 12:03 AM,and im too scared so i let him pass,
Snowfish#4289,02-Jul-18 12:03 AM,cuz im a weenie,
Snowfish#4289,02-Jul-18 12:03 AM,so he does this,
Snowfish#4289,02-Jul-18 12:03 AM,(in shorts + a short sleeve shirt),
Snowfish#4289,02-Jul-18 12:03 AM,for like an hour,
unahb#8581,02-Jul-18 12:03 AM,Stories like this come around when yoh can’t mind your own business,
Snowfish#4289,02-Jul-18 12:03 AM,while we just sit and watch,
unahb#8581,02-Jul-18 12:03 AM,Jk ❤️,
Snowfish#4289,02-Jul-18 12:03 AM,finally after a bit,
Snowfish#4289,02-Jul-18 12:03 AM,he stops his cycle,
Snowfish#4289,02-Jul-18 12:03 AM,and sits down on the rock,
Snowfish#4289,02-Jul-18 12:04 AM,literally goes :NotLikeThis:,
Snowfish#4289,02-Jul-18 12:04 AM,and starts talking to himself,
Snowfish#4289,02-Jul-18 12:04 AM,(we're too scared to get close enough to make out the words),
sony#1234,02-Jul-18 12:04 AM,Oh wait that was me.,
suyashr99#7560,02-Jul-18 12:04 AM,Sleep walking?,
Snowfish#4289,02-Jul-18 12:04 AM,"once again, weenies.",
Snowfish#4289,02-Jul-18 12:04 AM,so we do the logical thing,
Snowfish#4289,02-Jul-18 12:04 AM,AND TRY TO MAKE AS MUCH NOISE AS FUCKING POSSIBLE,
Snowfish#4289,02-Jul-18 12:04 AM,like literally shouting,
Snowfish#4289,02-Jul-18 12:04 AM,no response,
Snowfish#4289,02-Jul-18 12:04 AM,banging these obnoxiously loud metal chairs against each other,
Snowfish#4289,02-Jul-18 12:04 AM,no response,
Snowfish#4289,02-Jul-18 12:05 AM,"so at this point we're like ""well this is isnt working""",
Snowfish#4289,02-Jul-18 12:05 AM,then we're going to finally approach him and try to like,
Snowfish#4289,02-Jul-18 12:05 AM,get him to do shit,
Snowfish#4289,02-Jul-18 12:05 AM,he gets up,
Snowfish#4289,02-Jul-18 12:05 AM,walks back to his dorm,
Snowfish#4289,02-Jul-18 12:05 AM,unlocks it,
Snowfish#4289,02-Jul-18 12:05 AM,goes inside,
Snowfish#4289,02-Jul-18 12:05 AM,"and we're like ""dude wtf just happened""",
Snowfish#4289,02-Jul-18 12:05 AM,we assume sleepwalking but it was like,
Snowfish#4289,02-Jul-18 12:05 AM,too creepy,
sony#1234,02-Jul-18 12:05 AM,Man I was just trying to stay awake,
sony#1234,02-Jul-18 12:05 AM,I had an exam in the am,

Snowfish#4289,02-Jul-18 12:05 AM,shut the fuck up,
Snowfish#4289,02-Jul-18 12:06 AM,like he didn't walk correctly,
Snowfish#4289,02-Jul-18 12:06 AM,i guess,
Snowfish#4289,02-Jul-18 12:06 AM,idk,
Snowfish#4289,02-Jul-18 12:06 AM,like he'd skip a little,
suyashr99#7560,02-Jul-18 12:06 AM,TFW you're just doing your morning calisthenics routines and some weirdos start following and screeching at you,
Snowfish#4289,02-Jul-18 12:06 AM,until he got over the rock,
Snowfish#4289,02-Jul-18 12:06 AM,then he'd like,
Snowfish#4289,02-Jul-18 12:06 AM,stumble around,
Snowfish#4289,02-Jul-18 12:06 AM,slouching and shit,
Snowfish#4289,02-Jul-18 12:06 AM,idk it was super fucking weird,
Snowfish#4289,02-Jul-18 12:06 AM,like robotic almost,
Snowfish#4289,02-Jul-18 12:06 AM,"so he goes back inside, we realize that he came outside at like",
udishab#2211,02-Jul-18 12:06 AM,maybe he was possessed,
Snowfish#4289,02-Jul-18 12:06 AM,4:15 or something,
Snowfish#4289,02-Jul-18 12:06 AM,maybe it was more like 3:15,
Snowfish#4289,02-Jul-18 12:06 AM,either way,
Snowfish#4289,02-Jul-18 12:06 AM,we have it down to the minute,
Snowfish#4289,02-Jul-18 12:06 AM,and we go,
Snowfish#4289,02-Jul-18 12:07 AM,"""dude what if he comes out at 5:15?"" (or 4:15, whatever is correct)",
Snowfish#4289,02-Jul-18 12:07 AM,and its like 5:05 at that point,
Snowfish#4289,02-Jul-18 12:07 AM,"so we're waiting, laughing ""hah  no way""",
Snowfish#4289,02-Jul-18 12:07 AM,SHUT UP,

Snowfish#4289,02-Jul-18 12:07 AM,we move toward the entrance to the dorm,
Snowfish#4289,02-Jul-18 12:07 AM,5:15,
Snowfish#4289,02-Jul-18 12:07 AM,a figure appears,
udishab#2211,02-Jul-18 12:07 AM,STORYTIME SHH,
Snowfish#4289,02-Jul-18 12:07 AM,he opens the door,
saxon_dr#3806,02-Jul-18 12:07 AM,ok,

Snowfish#4289,02-Jul-18 12:08 AM,"he touches the tree, jumps over the rock",
Snowfish#4289,02-Jul-18 12:08 AM,and then goes down the alleyway,
Snowfish#4289,02-Jul-18 12:08 AM,so we're still in shock,
Snowfish#4289,02-Jul-18 12:08 AM,then we're like,
Snowfish#4289,02-Jul-18 12:08 AM,"""oh shit we gotta follow him!""",
Snowfish#4289,02-Jul-18 12:08 AM,so we jump up,
Snowfish#4289,02-Jul-18 12:08 AM,run down the alleyway,
Snowfish#4289,02-Jul-18 12:08 AM,and he's nowhere to be found,
Snowfish#4289,02-Jul-18 12:08 AM,"and no, this was between cloudman and field(?)",
Snowfish#4289,02-Jul-18 12:08 AM,now this isnt like an area where he could easily like,

Snowfish#4289,02-Jul-18 12:09 AM,the stairs are at that little lip at the top,
Snowfish#4289,02-Jul-18 12:09 AM,and we were sitting around the D in Cloudman Residence Hall,
Snowfish#4289,02-Jul-18 12:10 AM,so like,

Snowfish#4289,02-Jul-18 12:10 AM,second one,
Snowfish#4289,02-Jul-18 12:10 AM,so we try to follow his cycle,

Snowfish#4289,02-Jul-18 12:10 AM,scares the shit out of us,

MooshRum#3936,02-Jul-18 12:39 AM,snowfish is in the picture,
Gadget246#0848,02-Jul-18 12:40 AM,"yeah ambien is a reasonable explanation from the story, except for the whole ""every hour on the hour"" thing",
