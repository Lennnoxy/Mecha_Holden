To function, this bot requires server chatlog files created by DiscordChatExporter, a 3rd party program.
https://github.com/Tyrrrz/DiscordChatExporter

However, it should function with the log currently stored as GT22.csv

Useful Note:
File paths will still work if you remove all my E:\Python\Discord bot\ nonsense. I forgot to update that in the notepad code. Just keep it Pictures\\picture.png

And if you guys want me to add commands, just PM me the code to do so.

"But Lennox! GitHub exists to avoid that exact scenario!"

fair point.
